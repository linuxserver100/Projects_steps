Implementing email link click authentication for SSH using a combination of `ForceCommand`, a custom script, and email generation involves several steps. This approach requires SSH to execute a specific command when a user connects, and that command includes authentication via a link sent to their email. Here’s a detailed guide to achieving this:

### Step 1: Setup Email Sending with `ssmtp`

1. **Install `ssmtp`:**
   Ensure that `ssmtp` is installed on your server. You can install it using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ssmtp
   ```

2. **Configure `ssmtp`:**
   Configure the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` file for your SMTP server. For example:

   ```plaintext
   root=postmaster
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   ```

3. **Set Up Email Sending Script:**
   Create a script that sends an email with a unique link. Here’s an example script (`send_auth_email.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   EMAIL="$1"
   AUTH_CODE="$(openssl rand -hex 12)"
   LINK="http://yourdomain.com/authenticate?code=$AUTH_CODE"

   echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate your SSH session: $LINK" | ssmtp "$EMAIL"

   # Store AUTH_CODE and associate it with the user
   #echo "$AUTH_CODE" > "/tmp/auth_code_$USER"
   # echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo tee "/tmp/auth_code_$USER" > /dev/null
   #echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo tee "/tmp/auth_code_root" > /dev/null
   #echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo tee "/tmp/auth_code_root" > /dev/null && sudo chmod +x /tmp/auth_code_root
    echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo -u <username> tee "/tmp/auth_code_root" > /dev/null && sudo chmod +x /tmp/auth_code_root && chmod 644 /tmp/auth_code_root
   
   
   ```

   Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x send_auth_email.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Create the Authentication Script

This script will handle the authentication when the user clicks the link.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# auth_link.sh
AUTH_CODE="$1"
USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE="/tmp/auth_code_$USER"

# Debugging: Check if file exists
echo "Looking for auth code file: $USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE"

# Create a test auth code if the file doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Creating auth code file with a test code."
    echo "12345" > "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE"
fi

# Check if the code matches the stored one
if [ -f "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE" ]; then
    STORED_CODE="$(cat $USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE)"
    if [ "$AUTH_CODE" == "$STORED_CODE" ]; then
        echo "Authentication successful."
        rm "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE"  # Cleanup
        exec $SHELL  # Open a shell session
    else
        echo "Authentication failed."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "No authentication code found."
    exit 1
fi

```

Make this script executable:

```bash
chmod +x auth_link.sh
```

### Step 3: Update SSH Configuration

1. **Edit SSHD Configuration:**
   Open your SSH daemon configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and add or modify the following line:

   ```plaintext
   ForceCommand /path/to/send_auth_email.sh $USER; exec /path/to/auth_link.sh
   ```

   Ensure to replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to your scripts.

2. **Set Up the Shell Environment:**
   In the same configuration file, set the default shell to your desired shell if needed:

   ```plaintext
   Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
   ```

### Step 4: Create the Link Handling Mechanism

You'll need a web server to handle the GET request from the link that the user clicks. Here’s a simple example using PHP:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['code'])) {
    $code = $_GET['code'];
    // Call the authentication script with the code
    $output = shell_exec("/path/to/auth_link.sh $code 2>&1");
    echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
} else {
    echo "No code provided.";
}
?>
```

### Step 5: Restart SSH Service

After configuring everything, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Final Considerations

- **Security:** Ensure your scripts are secured and only accessible to authorized users.
- **Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up expired or used authentication codes.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire workflow to ensure users can authenticate smoothly.
- **Logging:** Consider adding logging for both successful and failed authentication attempts.

This setup combines SSH with email authentication, adding a layer of security for remote access.

To implement email-based link-click authentication for SSH access using `ForceCommand`, you can combine several tools and steps, including generating an authentication email, creating a custom script to verify authentication, and utilizing `ForceCommand` to control the SSH session. Here’s an outline of how you can set this up on a Linux server:

### Prerequisites

1. **ssmtp (or another email-sending tool)**: To send emails.
2. **A web server**: To host the authentication link.
3. **A custom shell script**: To verify the authentication link.
4. **SSH ForceCommand**: To control SSH command execution.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Set Up `ssmtp` (or Similar) to Send Emails

Install `ssmtp` and configure it to work with an email provider (e.g., Gmail, Postfix, etc.). If `ssmtp` is not suitable for your needs, you could also use `sendmail` or `mail`.

Example configuration for `ssmtp`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```

Configure `ssmtp` by editing `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`:
```conf
root=username@gmail.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthUser=username@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

#### 2. Create the Custom Authentication Script

This script will generate a unique token for each SSH session and send it as part of a clickable link in an email.

- Create a directory for temporary tokens, like `/tmp/auth_tokens/`.
- Create a custom script, `auth_check.sh`, to generate the link and send an email with the token.

Here's an example of `auth_check.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
EMAIL="user@example.com"  # Email to send the link
TOKEN_FILE="/tmp/auth_tokens"
TOKEN=$(uuidgen)  # Generate a unique token
URL="http://yourserver.com/verify?token=$TOKEN"  # Verification URL

# Store the token in a file with the user's name
#echo "$TOKEN" > "$TOKEN_FILE/${USER}.token"
 echo "$TOKEN" | tee "/tmp/auth_tokens/$USER.token" > /dev/null


# Send an email with the token link using ssmtp
echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate:\n$URL" | ssmtp "$EMAIL"

echo "An authentication link has been sent to your email. Please click the link to complete the SSH login."
echo "Waiting for authentication..."

# Wait for the file to be updated or deleted as a sign of authentication
while [ -f "$TOKEN_FILE/${USER}.token" ]; do
  sleep 1
done

# If the file is deleted, authentication succeeded
echo "Authentication successful. Welcome!"
exec $SHELL  # Proceed to the user's shell
```

#### 3. Configure the Web Server to Verify the Token

Set up a simple server-side script (like in PHP or Python) to delete the token file when the user clicks the link. For example, a PHP script `verify.php` could look like this:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    $user_token_file = "/tmp/auth_tokens/{$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']}.token";

    // Debug: Output token and file path
    echo "Token from URL: " . htmlspecialchars($token) . "<br>";
    echo "File path: " . htmlspecialchars($user_token_file) . "<br>";
    
    if (file_exists($user_token_file)) {
        $file_token = trim(file_get_contents($user_token_file));
        echo "Token from file: " . htmlspecialchars($file_token) . "<br>";
        
        if ($file_token === $token) {
            unlink($user_token_file);
            echo "Authentication successful!";
        } else {
            echo "Invalid or expired token.";
        }
    } else {
        echo "Token file does not exist.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>

```

Place `verify.php` on your web server and ensure it’s accessible at the URL defined in `auth_check.sh`.

#### 4. Set Up `ForceCommand` in SSH Configuration

Configure SSH to use `ForceCommand` to run the authentication script `auth_check.sh` whenever a user logs in.

1. Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
2. Add a `ForceCommand` entry for the users who need email link-click authentication. For example:

```conf
Match User your_ssh_user
    ForceCommand /path/to/auth_check.sh
```

3. Reload SSH to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

### How It Works

1. When the specified user logs in over SSH, `ForceCommand` runs `auth_check.sh`.
2. `auth_check.sh` generates a token, saves it, and sends an email with a verification link.
3. The user clicks the link in their email, triggering the server-side script (`verify.php`), which deletes the token file if the token is valid.
4. `auth_check.sh` detects the file deletion and grants access by launching the user’s default shell.

### Important Security Considerations

- **SSL**: Ensure your web server uses HTTPS to protect token transmission.
- **Permissions**: Restrict permissions for `/tmp/auth_tokens` and the scripts to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Token Expiration**: Consider implementing a timeout mechanism in `auth_check.sh` to delete stale tokens.

With this setup, users must verify each SSH session via email link click, adding an extra layer of security.

Implementing email-based link-click authentication for SSH access using `ForceCommand` involves several steps. Below is a guide on how to set up this system, including generating an authentication email, creating a custom script to verify the authentication link, and utilizing `ForceCommand` to control the SSH session.

### Prerequisites

1. **SSMTP or equivalent**: Ensure that you have a mail transfer agent (like `ssmtp`, `msmtp`, or `sendmail`) configured to send emails from your server.
2. **SSH Server**: Have an SSH server (like OpenSSH) installed and configured on your system.

### Steps to Implement Email-Based Link-Click Authentication

#### 1. Set Up SSMTP

First, configure `ssmtp` to send emails. Edit the configuration file, typically found at `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`, with the necessary SMTP server details.

```bash
# /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.your-email-provider.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
UseSTARTTLS=YES
UseTLS=YES
```

#### 2. Generate Authentication Email

Create a script that generates a unique authentication token, saves it, and sends an email with a link to that token.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# auth_email.sh
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
USER=$(echo $1)  # Get the username

# Save the token and username to a file or database
echo "$USER:$TOKEN" >> /tmp/auth_tokens.txt

# Create the authentication link
LINK="http://yourserver.com/authenticate.php?token=$TOKEN&user=$USER"

# Send the email
echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate your SSH session:" $LINK | ssmtp $USER
```

Make sure this script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x auth_email.sh
```

#### 3. Create the Verification Script

Create a script that verifies the token when clicked.

```php
<?php
// authenticate.php
session_start();
$user = $_GET['user'];
$token = $_GET['token'];

// Read the tokens file
$tokens = file('/tmp/auth_tokens.txt', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES | FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES);
foreach ($tokens as $line) {
    list($lineUser, $lineToken) = explode(':', $line);
    if ($lineUser === $user && $lineToken === $token) {
        // Token is valid, log the user in
        $_SESSION['authenticated_user'] = $user;
        // Remove the token from the file
        unset($tokens[array_search($line, $tokens)]);
        file_put_contents('/tmp/auth_tokens.txt', implode("\n", $tokens));
        echo "Authenticated. You can now access the SSH.";
        exit;
    }
}
echo "Invalid token.";
?>
```

#### 4. Use `ForceCommand` in SSH Configuration

Modify your `sshd_config` file (usually located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to set up `ForceCommand` to use your verification script.

```bash
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /path/to/verify_auth.sh
```

#### 5. Create the Verification Script for SSH

Create a script that will check if the user is authenticated.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# verify_auth.sh
if [[ -z "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]; then
    echo "SSH connection not established."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the user is authenticated
if [[ -z "$USER" || ! -f /tmp/auth_tokens.txt ]]; then
    echo "Not authenticated. Please check your email for the authentication link."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the session is authenticated
if grep -q "$USER" /tmp/auth_tokens.txt; then
    echo "Authenticated. You can now access the shell."
    exec $SHELL  # Replace with the user's shell
else
    echo "Authentication failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
chmod +x verify_auth.sh
```

#### 6. Restart SSH Service

After making changes to the SSH configuration, restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Conclusion

With this setup:

1. When a user tries to SSH, they will be prompted to check their email for an authentication link.
2. Clicking the link will authenticate the user, removing the token from the file to prevent reuse.
3. If authenticated, the user gains access to their shell.

### Important Security Considerations

- Ensure secure handling of tokens and user data.
- Regularly clean the `/tmp/auth_tokens.txt` file to remove expired tokens.
- Consider using HTTPS for your web server to secure the authentication link.

This is a basic implementation; you may want to extend it with additional security measures, such as logging, token expiration, and more robust session management.

        $_SESSION['authenticated_user'] = $user;

        // Regenerate session ID to prevent session fixation
        session_regenerate_id(true);

        // Remove the token from the file
        unset($tokens[array_search($line, $tokens)]);
        
        // Write the updated token list back to the file
        if (file_put_contents($tokensFile, implode("\n", $tokens) . "\n") === false) {
            echo "Error updating token file.";
            exit;
        }

        echo "Authenticated. You can now access the SSH.";
        exit;
    }
}

echo "Invalid token.";
?>

To set up SSH login via an email link verification system and use `ForcedCommand` with `$SHELL` access, you can implement a solution by integrating several components. Here's an outline of how you can achieve this:

### 1. **SSH ForcedCommand Configuration**
   The `ForcedCommand` option in the SSH configuration forces the server to execute a specific command for every login, regardless of what the user attempts to run. In your case, we will configure it to allow the user to log in only if they pass a secondary email verification process.

   **Steps:**
   - Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the server.
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - Add the following lines:
     ```
     Match User * 
         ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/verify_ssh_login.sh
         AllowTcpForwarding no
         X11Forwarding no
     ```
     This will ensure that every user triggers the `verify_ssh_login.sh` script on login.

### 2. **Email Verification Process**
   You'll need a system to send an email with a unique verification link that the user must click before proceeding with SSH login. This involves setting up a mechanism to generate a one-time link and then checking the link when the user logs in.

   **Steps:**
   - **Install SSMTP (or an SMTP client):**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ssmtp
     ```
   - **Configure your email client:**
     Edit the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to configure the outgoing mail server (you may use Gmail's SMTP server or any other service).
     Example configuration for Gmail:
     ```ini
     root=postmaster@gmail.com
     mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
     AuthUser=your_email@gmail.com
     AuthPass=your_password
     FromLineOverride=YES
     UseSTARTTLS=YES
     ```
   - **Create the verification script:**
     You'll need a custom script to generate a one-time login token and send it to the user via email.

     Here's a sample script (`/usr/local/bin/verify_ssh_login.sh`):

     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     # verify_ssh_login.sh
     
     # Assume the username is the email
     USER_EMAIL="$USER@example.com"
     LOGIN_TOKEN=$(uuidgen)
     VERIFICATION_LINK="https://your-domain.com/verify?token=$LOGIN_TOKEN"

     # Store the token in a temporary file or database
     echo "$LOGIN_TOKEN $USER_EMAIL" > /tmp/ssh_login_tokens.txt

     # Send the email
     echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Verification\n\nPlease click the link to verify your login: $VERIFICATION_LINK" | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL
     
     echo "A verification link has been sent to your email. Please click it to complete the login."
     exit 1  # Prevent login until the verification link is clicked
     ```

   - **Set execute permissions for the script:**
     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/verify_ssh_login.sh
     ```

### 3. **Web Interface for Verification Link**
   Create a web page that the user can visit by clicking the link in their email. This web page will verify the token and then allow the user to continue with their SSH session.

   **Steps:**
   - Set up a simple web server (for example, Apache, Nginx, or any server of your choice) to handle the verification page.
   - The script should check the token against the list of generated tokens (`/tmp/ssh_login_tokens.txt` or a database).
   - After the user clicks the verification link, the server should delete the token from the list, allowing the SSH session to continue.

   **Example PHP verification page (verification.php):**
   ```php
   <?php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    $file = '/tmp/ssh_login_tokens.txt';

    // Check if file exists
    if (file_exists($file)) {
        $tokens = file($file, FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES);
        $isVerified = false;

        foreach ($tokens as $index => $line) {
            list($stored_token, $user_email) = explode(' ', $line);

            // Compare the token
            if ($stored_token == $token) {
                // Token is valid, proceed with the process (e.g., mark as verified)
                unset($tokens[$index]); // Remove the verified token

                // Update the file
                file_put_contents($file, implode("\n", $tokens));

                echo "Verification successful. You may now return to your SSH session.";
                $isVerified = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!$isVerified) {
            echo "Invalid token.";
        }
    } else {
        echo "Token file not found.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>

   ```

### 4. **Finalizing SSH Login Process**
   - After the user clicks the verification link, the `verify_ssh_login.sh` script will allow the SSH session to proceed. You may use a flag or update the status in a file to indicate the user has successfully verified their login.

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   if [ ! -f /tmp/ssh_login_verified_$USER ]; then
       echo "Please verify your login by clicking the link sent to your email."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Allow login
   exec $SHELL
   ```

### Summary
This solution requires:
1. Configuring SSH `ForcedCommand` to run a verification script.
2. Sending a verification email with a unique token using `ssmtp`.
3. Providing a verification link for the user to click.
4. Setting up a web server to verify the token and update the login status.

This provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that users cannot log in without verifying their email first.

To set up SSH login via email link verification, with the forced command and email features like `ssmtp` or `php`, you'd typically follow these general steps:

### Overview of the Process:
1. **User Initiates SSH Login**: The user attempts to log in via SSH.
2. **Email Verification**: An email with a login link is sent to the user's registered email address.
3. **Forced Command Setup**: Once the user clicks the link, SSH access is granted with a restricted environment using the `forcedcommand` directive.
4. **$SHELL and Access Codes**: The server returns the user's shell or a custom shell based on the login script execution.

### Prerequisites:
- **Email System**: You need a mail system (like `ssmtp` or `sendmail`) installed and configured to send emails.
- **PHP**: You’ll need PHP installed to handle dynamic link generation and email sending.
- **SSH Setup**: Ensure SSH is configured to support forced commands and user verification.

### Steps:

#### 1. **Install Required Packages**:
Make sure the required tools are installed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp sendmail php openssh-server
```

#### 2. **Configure Mail System (ssmtp or sendmail)**:
- For `ssmtp`, you will need to configure it in `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` with your SMTP server details.

Example `ssmtp.conf`:
```conf
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.your-email-provider.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

- If using `sendmail`, configure it according to your system and email provider.

#### 3. **PHP Script for Email Generation**:
Create a PHP script that generates a unique login link and sends it to the user’s email address.

```php
<?php
$email = $_POST['email'];
$login_token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));  // Create a unique token

// Store the token with the email for later verification
file_put_contents('/tmp/verification_tokens.txt', "$email:$login_token\n", FILE_APPEND);

// Generate login link
$link = "https://yourserver.com/verify.php?token=$login_token&email=$email";

// Send the email
$subject = "SSH Login Verification";
$message = "Click the following link to log in: $link";
mail($email, $subject, $message, "From: your-email@example.com");

echo "A verification email has been sent.";
?>
```

#### 4. **Verification Script (verify.php)**:
This script handles the verification when the user clicks the link.

```php
<?php
$token = $_GET['token'];
$email = $_GET['email'];

// Check if token exists in the stored list
$tokens = file('/tmp/verification_tokens.txt', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES);
foreach ($tokens as $line) {
    list($stored_email, $stored_token) = explode(':', $line);
    if ($stored_email === $email && $stored_token === $token) {
        // Token is valid, proceed with SSH login setup
        header('Location: ssh://yourserver.com');
        exit;
    }
}

echo "Invalid token.";
?>
```

#### 5. **Configure SSH with ForcedCommand**:
In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, you can configure SSH to execute a command upon successful login.

```bash
Match User yourusername
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/verify_user_login.sh
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
```

This will execute a custom script (`/usr/local/bin/verify_user_login.sh`) when the user logs in.

#### 6. **Verification Script (`verify_user_login.sh`)**:
The script verifies the login, and can enforce restrictions, including setting the user’s `$SHELL` based on their verification.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# You can add custom logic to verify the user’s login
# Example: Check for a file or a token passed

echo "Welcome to the server, $USER"

# Optionally set the user's shell based on a condition
export SHELL="/bin/bash"
```

Make sure this script is executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/verify_user_login.sh
```

#### 7. **Restart SSH Server**:
After configuring the SSH server, restart it to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### How It Works:
1. **User initiates login**: The user attempts to SSH into the server.
2. **Verification via email**: The server sends an email with a link.
3. **Link clicked**: User clicks on the email link to verify the login.
4. **SSH Forced Command**: Once the user is verified, the `ForceCommand` in SSH configuration allows a restricted command to run, allowing login with the desired shell or restricting access based on `$SHELL`.

This setup uses a combination of email verification, PHP scripts, SSH forced commands, and custom scripts to manage user access.

To set up an SSH login using an email link for verification, you can combine SSH with a verification process that sends a link to the user via email. Here’s how you can go about implementing it:

### 1. Setup a Web Server to Handle the Email Verification and SSH Authentication:
You need a system to send emails with unique links to the user that contain a verification token. Once clicked, the token should be verified, and the user can be granted access to the server via SSH.

1. **Install required packages**:
   - Ensure that `ssmtp` (or `msmtp` depending on your distro) is installed for sending emails.
   - Install PHP and a web server like Apache to serve the PHP verification scripts.

   On Ubuntu, you can install the necessary tools like this:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ssmtp msmtp php libapache2-mod-php apache2
   ```

2. **Configure ssmtp/msmtp**:
   Edit the `ssmtp` or `msmtp` configuration file to connect to your email service provider (e.g., Gmail).

   - For `msmtp`, the configuration file `/etc/msmtprc` might look like this:

     ```plaintext
     account gmail
     host smtp.gmail.com
     port 587
     from your-email@gmail.com
     user your-email@gmail.com
     password your-password
     tls on
     logfile /var/log/msmtp.log

     account default : gmail
     ```

   - For `ssmtp`, you will modify `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` similarly.

3. **PHP script to send verification email**:
   Write a PHP script that generates a unique verification link and sends it via email:

   ```php
   <?php
   $email = $_POST['email']; // user inputs email address
   $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // Generate a random token

   // Save the token to a database or flat file, associated with the user's email
   file_put_contents('/path/to/tokens.txt', "$email:$token\n", FILE_APPEND);

   $verification_link = "https://yourdomain.com/verify.php?token=$token";

   // Send verification email via msmtp or ssmtp
   mail($email, "SSH Login Verification", "Click on the following link to verify your SSH login: $verification_link");

   echo "A verification link has been sent to your email.";
   ?>
   ```

4. **Verification Script (verify.php)**:
   After the user clicks the link, the server should verify the token and allow SSH access if valid.

   ```php
   <?php
   $token = $_GET['token']; // Token from the email link
   $tokens = file('/path/to/tokens.txt');

   foreach ($tokens as $line) {
       list($email, $saved_token) = explode(':', trim($line));
       if ($saved_token == $token) {
           // Token is valid, grant SSH access
           // Here, you could set up a temporary SSH login method or log the user in
           // You can also remove or expire the token from the file after use
           echo "Token verified. You can now SSH into the server.";
           exit;
       }
   }

   echo "Invalid or expired token.";
   ?>
   ```

### 2. Enforce `ForcedCommand` in SSH:
To limit SSH access to only the validated users through this link, configure the `sshd_config` with a `ForcedCommand` that allows only specific actions (e.g., running a specific shell script after email verification):

```bash
# In /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Match User * 
    ForceCommand /path/to/verify_script.sh
```

The script could check if the user has been validated before allowing a real shell session or force a specific command.

### 3. Verification and $SHELL Access Codes Features:
Ensure the `verify_script.sh` checks for a valid token or logs the user’s session accordingly. For instance:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script checks if the user has been validated through the email link
if [[ -f "/path/to/verified_users.txt" && $(grep -q "$USER" /path/to/verified_users.txt) ]]; then
    exec $SHELL  # Allow shell access if the user is verified
else
    echo "Your verification is pending or expired."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 4. Sending Emails with PHP (`ssmtp` or `msmtp`):
Ensure the PHP `mail()` function is working by configuring the system's SMTP settings. With `ssmtp` or `msmtp` configured, emails will be sent via the configured SMTP server (Gmail, for example) to the user's email with the verification link.

---

### Security Considerations:
- **Token Expiry**: Ensure tokens have an expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes) to avoid abuse.
- **Token Storage**: Store tokens securely (in a database, not in plain text files) and hash them to improve security.
- **SSH Configuration**: Secure your SSH configuration and ensure the forced commands or scripts don't introduce security risks.

### Conclusion:
By combining PHP, SSH forced commands, and a token-based verification process, you can effectively implement an email link for SSH login verification.

Setting up SSH login via an email link verification system and using ForcedCommand with `$SHELL` access involves several steps, integrating various components such as SSH, email verification, and `ForcedCommand`. Here's a guide on how to achieve this:

### Components Involved:
1. **SSMTP**: To send email verification links.
2. **SSH**: For securing remote access to the server.
3. **ForcedCommand**: To restrict users to a specific shell or action.
4. **Email Link Verification**: A mechanism for sending a verification link to the user for authentication.

### Steps to Implement SSH Login with Email Verification and ForcedCommand

#### 1. **Install SSMTP**
First, install `ssmtp` on the server to send email via a third-party SMTP server (e.g., Gmail).

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```

#### 2. **Configure SSMTP**
Set up your SMTP configuration for sending emails. The configuration file is usually located at `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`.

Edit the `ssmtp.conf` file with your email service details:

```bash
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=your-email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
```

Ensure that "Less secure apps" access is enabled in your email provider (if using Gmail, for example).

#### 3. **Create a Simple Script for Email Verification**
You can use a custom script to generate a verification link and send it via email. The script will be responsible for generating a unique token, sending the email, and then verifying it when the user tries to authenticate via SSH.

For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify-email.sh

# Generate a unique token (you can use any method you prefer for this)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Send the email with the verification link
echo "Subject: SSH Login Verification" | cat - email_body.txt | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL

# Email Body
echo "Click the link below to verify your SSH login:
https://yourserver.com/verify-token?token=$TOKEN" > email_body.txt
```

Ensure that the user will have to click the link (which sends the token to the server) to complete verification.

#### 4. **Verify the Token**
On your server, you'll need a web service or script that listens for incoming verification requests. When a user clicks the link, the server should compare the token in the URL with the one stored in a file or database.

Here’s a simple example using `nginx` and PHP:

1. Install Nginx and PHP:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nginx php-fpm
   ```

2. Configure `nginx` to handle the verification request.

   Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to include a location for the token verification endpoint.

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;

       location /verify-token {
           fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
           fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/html/verify-token.php;
           include fastcgi_params;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Create the `verify-token.php` script:

   ```php
   <?php
   if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
       $token = $_GET['token'];

       // Compare the token with the one stored (in a database or file)
       if (tokenIsValid($token)) {
           echo "Token verified!";
           // Proceed with SSH login process, allow access, or set a flag
       } else {
           echo "Invalid token.";
       }
   }

   function tokenIsValid($token) {
       // Implement your token validation logic here
       return file_get_contents('/path/to/token_file') === $token;
   }
   ?>
   ```

#### 5. **Configure SSH for ForcedCommand**
Now, you'll set up SSH to use ForcedCommand and provide access to `$SHELL`.

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following configuration:

```bash
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /path/to/your/custom-shell-script.sh
    PasswordAuthentication no
```

In your `custom-shell-script.sh`, you can include logic to check if the user has verified their email. If not, deny the login.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# custom-shell-script.sh

# Check if the user has verified their email (e.g., by checking a file or database)
if [ ! -f /path/to/user_verified ]; then
    echo "Email verification required."
    exit 1
fi

# Proceed with the default shell if verified
exec $SHELL
```

#### 6. **Finalize and Test**
1. **Restart the SSH service** to apply the configuration changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

2. **Test the entire process**:
   - The user attempts to log in via SSH.
   - The server sends a verification email with a link.
   - The user clicks the link to verify their identity.
   - After verification, the user gains access to the shell.

### Notes:
- You can modify the script to store the token in a database or file for checking.
- The `ForceCommand` option ensures that users are always executed through the shell script.
- Email services like Gmail may require additional configuration (such as app-specific passwords) for sending emails securely.

This setup should provide a basic structure for an SSH login system with email verification and ForcedCommand enforcement.

.
To set up an SSH login system that integrates email link verification and ForcedCommand with `$SHELL` access, you’ll need to work with several components. Below is a high-level guide for implementing such a system:

### Overview
1. **SSH Login**: Use SSH for authenticating users.
2. **Email Verification**: Upon login, the system will send an email containing a one-time link for verification.
3. **ForcedCommand**: Use SSH’s `ForceCommand` directive to restrict user access to a specific shell (e.g., `$SHELL`), or a command to verify the link and then execute a shell after successful verification.
4. **Send Email**: Use a mail service like `ssmtp` (or other alternatives like `msmtp` or `sendmail`) to send the verification link to the user.

### Prerequisites
- A running **SSH server**.
- A configured **mail system** (e.g., `ssmtp` or `msmtp`).
- Basic understanding of **bash scripting** and **SSH configurations**.
  
### Steps to Implement the Solution

#### 1. **Set Up SSH Server**
Ensure SSH is installed and configured on the server. Typically, SSH is configured through `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Here are the main steps:

- Open the SSH config file:  
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```

- Allow password authentication and disable root login (for security purposes).
  ```bash
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```

- Configure `ForceCommand` to specify a custom script:
  ```bash
  ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh_verification_script.sh
  ```

#### 2. **Create SSH Verification Script**
This script will be triggered every time a user attempts to log in via SSH. It will check if the user has already verified via email.

- **Create the script:**
  ```bash
  sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ssh_verification_script.sh
  ```

- **Example Script:**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  
  # Check if the user is already verified by looking for a verification flag
  if [ -f "/tmp/$USER_verified" ]; then
    exec $SHELL  # If verified, launch the shell
  else
    # Generate a unique verification token and send it via email
    verification_token=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
    echo $verification_token > /tmp/$USER_token

    # Send email with verification link
    verification_link="http://yourserver.com/verify?user=$USER&token=$verification_token"
    echo "Please verify your login by clicking this link: $verification_link" | ssmtp user@example.com

    # Display message prompting the user to verify
    echo "Verification email sent. Please check your inbox to complete login."
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

  - This script checks if a user has a file `/tmp/$USER_verified`. If the file exists, it means the user has already verified their email and is allowed to use the shell.
  - If not verified, it generates a token, writes it to a temporary file, and sends an email with the verification link using `ssmtp`.

#### 3. **Set Up a Web Server for Verification**
You need a web server to handle the verification link clicked by the user. Here's how you can implement it:

- **Install Apache/Nginx** (e.g., Apache):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install apache2
  ```

- **Create a PHP script** for verification:
  ```php
  <?php
  // Get user and token from the URL
  $user = $_GET['user'];
  $token = $_GET['token'];

  // Check if the token matches the stored token
  if (file_exists("/tmp/${user}_token") && file_get_contents("/tmp/${user}_token") == $token) {
    // Mark user as verified
    touch("/tmp/${user}_verified");

    echo "You have been successfully verified! You can now login to your account.";
  } else {
    echo "Verification failed or token expired.";
  }
  ?>
  ```

  - This PHP script checks if the token in the URL matches the one saved in `/tmp/${user}_token`.
  - If the tokens match, it creates a `/tmp/${user}_verified` file, indicating that the user is verified.

- **Make sure your server is publicly accessible** (e.g., `yourserver.com`).

#### 4. **Test the Process**
- When the user logs in via SSH, the system will check for the verification file.
- If not verified, the script sends an email with the verification link.
- The user clicks the link, which verifies them and allows access to the shell on the next login.

#### 5. **Email Setup**
Ensure you have a working email setup with `ssmtp`, `msmtp`, or another service on the server:

- **Install ssmtp**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ssmtp
  ```

- **Configure `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`** for your email provider:
  ```bash
  root=your-email@example.com
  mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
  AuthUser=your-email@example.com
  AuthPass=your-email-password
  UseTLS=YES
  ```

- Make sure you can send test emails:
  ```bash
  echo "Test email body" | ssmtp recipient@example.com
  ```

#### 6. **Security Considerations**
- Use HTTPS for the verification link to protect the token.
- Ensure temporary files like `/tmp/$USER_token` and `/tmp/$USER_verified` are cleaned up after verification.
- Set proper permissions for the script and files to prevent unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
This method integrates email verification into the SSH login process with the `ForceCommand` directive and `$SHELL` access. It adds a layer of security by ensuring that only users who have clicked the verification link can log into the system.

Setting up SSH login with email link-click authentication on an Ubuntu server using `ssmtp`, PHP, and `ForceCommand` is a complex setup. Below are simplified instructions on how you could implement such a solution, focusing on the necessary steps and configurations. However, please note that email link-click authentication for SSH access is unconventional and may require custom development for secure implementation.

### Steps to Achieve SSH Login with Email Link Click Authentication

#### 1. Install Required Software

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **OpenSSH server** for SSH access
- **ssmtp** for sending emails
- **PHP** for handling server-side logic

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server ssmtp php
```

#### 2. Configure ssmtp

Edit the `ssmtp` configuration to set up your email server.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
```

Here's a sample configuration for Gmail. Replace with your email provider's SMTP settings:

```bash
root=postmaster@example.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=YES
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you may need to enable less secure apps or set up App Passwords for enhanced security.

#### 3. Configure PHP for Sending Email

Create a PHP script to handle the email link generation and verification. Here is an example of how you can send an email with a verification link.

```php
<?php
$to = "user@example.com";
$subject = "SSH Login Link";
$token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // Generate a random token for authentication
$verification_link = "http://your-server-ip/verify.php?token=$token";

// Store the token temporarily in a database or file for validation later
file_put_contents("tokens/$token.txt", "user@example.com");

$message = "Click the link below to authenticate your SSH login:\n$verification_link";

$headers = 'From: no-reply@your-server.com' . "\r\n" .
           'Reply-To: no-reply@your-server.com' . "\r\n" .
           'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();

mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
echo "Verification link sent to $to!";
?>
```

#### 4. Create Verification Script (`verify.php`)

This script verifies the token and allows the user to initiate the SSH login.

```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];

    if(file_exists("tokens/$token.txt")) {
        $email = file_get_contents("tokens/$token.txt");
        // Start a session and store the email in it for future use
        session_start();
        $_SESSION['user_email'] = $email;

        // Redirect to a page indicating successful login or directly handle SSH session
        echo "You have been authenticated! Please proceed to SSH.";
    } else {
        echo "Invalid or expired token!";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided!";
}
?>
```

#### 5. Modify `sshd_config` to Use ForceCommand

You need to set up `ForceCommand` in `sshd_config` to run a custom script once the user logs in through SSH. This can ensure the user is only allowed to log in if they are authenticated via the email link.

Edit the SSH configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following line to the `sshd_config`:

```bash
ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh-login-script.sh
```

This ensures that once the SSH session is initiated, the custom script `ssh-login-script.sh` will be executed. 

#### 6. Create the SSH Login Script (`ssh-login-script.sh`)

Now, create a simple script that will check if the user has been authenticated through the email link:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ssh-login-script.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user has been authenticated via email
if [ -f "/tmp/authorized_user" ]; then
    # If authenticated, allow them to access the shell
    $SHELL
else
    # If not authenticated, close the connection
    echo "You need to authenticate via email to log in."
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 7. Implement the Email Login Validation

When the user clicks on the link in the email, you should save a session or token indicating that they are authenticated. You can create a file in `/tmp/authorized_user` to signify that the user is authorized to log in.

Modify `verify.php` to create this file:

```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];

    if(file_exists("tokens/$token.txt")) {
        $email = file_get_contents("tokens/$token.txt");

        // Store the authentication status in a temporary file
        file_put_contents("/tmp/authorized_user", $email);

        session_start();
        $_SESSION['user_email'] = $email;
        echo "You have been authenticated! Please proceed to SSH.";
    } else {
        echo "Invalid or expired token!";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided!";
}
?>
```

#### 8. Secure the Setup

Ensure that the authentication file (`/tmp/authorized_user`) is deleted after the session ends or after a timeout.

You might want to implement additional security features, such as limiting the validity of the token, logging out after a certain period, and securing access to the `/tmp/authorized_user` file.

---

### Final Thoughts

This is a basic guide for setting up SSH login via email verification on Ubuntu using PHP and `ssmtp`. However, implementing email-based authentication for SSH is non-standard, and you should consider using proven alternatives like multi-factor authentication (MFA) or SSH keys for better security.

To set up SSH login using email link click authentication in an Ubuntu server with shell access, you need to achieve two things:

1. **Configure SSMTP for sending emails**: SSMTP allows you to send emails without needing a full mail server, which is perfect for this setup.
2. **Use SSH's `ForceCommand` to restrict access to a shell script that can verify the email link click**.

This example will guide you through the steps using simple `.sh` scripts and `ssmtp` for email configuration. The idea is to generate a unique token for the user, send it via email, and have the user click on a link to authenticate, which triggers the shell script to authenticate their session.

### 1. **Install and Configure `ssmtp`**

Install `ssmtp` on your Ubuntu server to send emails from the server to the user's email.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp
```

Configure `ssmtp` by editing its configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
```

Here's a basic configuration for using Gmail (you can modify this for other email services):

```
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
hostname=yourdomain.com
AuthUser=your-email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

You will need to replace the `AuthUser` and `AuthPass` with your Gmail account and password. For added security, consider using an App Password if you're using Gmail.

### 2. **Create the Shell Script to Send the Authentication Link**

Create a script (`send_email.sh`) that generates a unique token and sends it via email.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a unique token (for simplicity, using the current timestamp)
token=$(date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 32)

# Store the token in a file
echo $token > /tmp/token.txt

# Prepare the authentication link
auth_link="http://your-server.com/verify_token?token=$token"

# Send the email with the link using ssmtp
echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate your SSH session:\n$auth_link" | ssmtp user@example.com

# Output the token (optional, for debugging purposes)
echo "Token sent: $auth_link"
```

### 3. **Set Up SSH Configuration with `ForceCommand`**

You can configure `ForceCommand` to restrict SSH login to a specific shell script that verifies the token when the user logs in.

Edit the SSH configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify these lines:

```
ForceCommand /path/to/your/verify_token.sh
AllowUsers yourusername
```

This configuration ensures that any login attempt will force the user to run the `verify_token.sh` script, instead of providing normal shell access.

### 4. **Create the Token Verification Script**

Create a script `verify_token.sh` that checks the token and allows the user to proceed if the token matches.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the token from the SSH command line arguments
provided_token=$1

# Check if the token matches the one stored
stored_token=$(cat /tmp/token.txt)

if [[ "$provided_token" == "$stored_token" ]]; then
    echo "Token validated. Access granted!"
    # Grant access to the shell (optional, you can customize further)
    /bin/bash
else
    echo "Invalid token. Access denied."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 5. **Triggering Token Verification from the Email Link**

When the user clicks the authentication link in their email, the server should verify the token. You can configure this to work with a web server (like Apache or Nginx) or even a local script that responds to HTTP requests.

Since you mentioned not using web access directly, a simple way to test is to store the tokens in a file and compare them in your shell script.

### Final Notes:

- **Security**: This method is for demonstration purposes. In a real production environment, you should implement secure methods to manage tokens (e.g., via HTTPS and cryptographic tokens).
- **Email Delivery**: Ensure that the email server can reliably deliver messages, especially when using a service like Gmail, which may flag your server as a spammer if it's sending too many emails.

Once everything is set up, you should be able to initiate the process by running the `send_email.sh` script. The user will receive an email with a link, and upon clicking, their SSH session will be validated via the `verify_token.sh` script.

To set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server via email link click authentication with `$SHELL` access using only `ssmtp`, `.sh` scripts, and `ForceCommand` in the `sshd_config` without web access, you can follow these steps.

### Requirements:
- Ubuntu server with `ssmtp` installed.
- SSH configured to allow specific commands via the `ForceCommand` option.

### Steps:

#### 1. Install `ssmtp` on the Ubuntu server

First, install `ssmtp` (a simple mail relay system):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp
```

#### 2. Configure `ssmtp`

Configure `ssmtp` for sending emails. The configuration file is `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`.

Edit the configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
```

Here’s an example configuration for Gmail (replace with your email provider’s details):

```bash
root=postmaster@example.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

Ensure that the email credentials and SMTP server details are correct. **Note:** It's highly recommended to use App Passwords instead of your regular email password for security reasons if you're using Gmail.

#### 3. Create a script to send a login link

Create a shell script that sends an email with a login link. You can generate a token or use a simple authentication method, for instance, with a random string:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a random authentication token (or use a simpler method)
AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 12)

# Send an email to the user with the authentication token
echo "Click the link below to authenticate your SSH session: \
https://yourserver.com/ssh-login/$AUTH_TOKEN" | ssmtp user@example.com

# Print token for reference (in production, you may store it securely)
echo "Generated authentication token: $AUTH_TOKEN"
```

Save this script as `send_login_link.sh` and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x send_login_link.sh
```

#### 4. Create a `ForceCommand` script

In `sshd_config`, set up the `ForceCommand` option to execute a script upon SSH login. Create a shell script (e.g., `verify_login.sh`) to verify the link or token.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Check if the login token matches one sent in the email
if [[ "$SSH_AUTH_TOKEN" == "$EXPECTED_TOKEN" ]]; then
    # If it matches, allow the user to proceed to their shell
    exec $SHELL
else
    # If not, deny access
    echo "Invalid authentication token."
    exit 1
fi
```

Save this script as `verify_login.sh` and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x verify_login.sh
```

#### 5. Configure SSH to use the script

In the SSH configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, set the `ForceCommand` option to execute the `verify_login.sh` script.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following line:

```bash
ForceCommand /path/to/verify_login.sh
```

#### 6. Restart the SSH service

After making changes to the SSH configuration, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### 7. Authentication process overview:

1. The user runs `send_login_link.sh` to send an email with the authentication token.
2. The user receives the email, clicks the link (which would be a token-based authentication URL).
3. Upon SSH login, the server checks the token against a stored or generated token (from email).
4. If the token is correct, the user is granted access to `$SHELL`.

### Security Considerations:
- This approach doesn't include web-based token validation, so it relies on a pre-shared method for token verification.
- You can extend the script to store the token securely in a file or database for better validation.
- Avoid hardcoding passwords or sensitive information in scripts, especially in a production environment.

This is a simple implementation, and in a real-world environment, you should consider additional security mechanisms, like 2FA or more robust token management.

To achieve SSH login authentication via email link click with `$SHELL` access using `ssmtp` and simple shell scripts on Ubuntu, you would need to implement a custom solution. Here's how you can approach this:

### 1. Prerequisites
- Ubuntu server running SSH.
- `ssmtp` installed for sending email notifications.
- Email service to send the link for SSH login.
- A basic shell script for generating a login link.
- Use of `ForceCommand` in the `sshd_config` for security.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Install `ssmtp` and Configure it
Install `ssmtp` for email sending.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp
```

#### Step 2: Configure `ssmtp` (`/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`)
Edit `ssmtp.conf` to configure your mail settings. You need to use a working SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
```

Here’s an example for Gmail:

```bash
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthUser=your_email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_email_password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=YES
```

#### Step 3: Create a Script to Send Email with a Login Link (`/usr/local/bin/send_login_link.sh`)
You need a script that generates a unique login link, sends it via email, and sets up the temporary SSH access.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate a unique link/token (could use UUID or any other method)
TOKEN=$(uuidgen)

# Set your email and recipient
FROM_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
TO_EMAIL="recipient_email@example.com"

# Prepare the login link (this could point to a script or page that validates the token)
LOGIN_LINK="ssh://$USER@$HOSTNAME?token=$TOKEN"

# Send the email with the login link
echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Link\n\nClick on the link to login to your server:\n$LOGIN_LINK" | ssmtp $TO_EMAIL
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_login_link.sh
```

#### Step 4: SSH Configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)
Modify SSH settings to force the login to run a specific command for validation when the user clicks the link.

Edit `sshd_config`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Ensure you have these settings:

```bash
ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/validate_login.sh
AllowUsers your_username
PasswordAuthentication no
```

The `ForceCommand` ensures that every SSH login will run the script `/usr/local/bin/validate_login.sh`, which will verify the login link.

#### Step 5: Create the Validation Script (`/usr/local/bin/validate_login.sh`)
This script will be responsible for validating the token received from the link.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Extract the token passed via SSH
TOKEN=$1

# Validate the token (you could store tokens in a file or database)
VALID_TOKEN="your_valid_token_here"

if [[ "$TOKEN" == "$VALID_TOKEN" ]]; then
  # Allow the user to continue with the shell
  exec $SHELL
else
  echo "Invalid token!"
  exit 1
fi
```

Make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/validate_login.sh
```

#### Step 6: Send the Login Link
Finally, you can run the `send_login_link.sh` script to send the login link to the recipient:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/send_login_link.sh
```

The recipient will get an email with the SSH login link. When they click the link, it will pass the token to the SSH login process, where the token will be validated. If valid, the user will be granted access to the shell.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Security**: This approach is highly simplified. In a production environment, you would need a more robust method for validating tokens (e.g., with an expiry time, or by storing tokens securely).
- **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling and logging in the scripts to ensure smooth operations.
- **Link Validation**: This example uses a static token. You may want to implement a more secure, time-sensitive token system (e.g., using time-based one-time passwords or a hashed method).

This solution provides basic functionality to authenticate SSH via email link and `$SHELL` access with `ssmtp`.

Below, I'll walk you through a generalized way to achieve this, but please note that this approach has potential security risks, especially with email-based authentication, and should only be used for internal or trusted environments. For production systems, use a more secure method, like SSH keys or two-factor authentication (2FA).

This configuration can be divided into several main parts:

1. **Set up `ssmtp` to send emails.**
2. **Create PHP scripts to handle email generation and verification.**
3. **Configure SSH with `ForceCommand` to restrict access until verification.**

Let's break down each part.

### Step 1: Configure `ssmtp` for Email Sending

Edit the `ssmtp.conf` file (typically located at `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`). Replace placeholders with your email server's settings:

```conf
# /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

# Replace these values with your SMTP server's details
root=your-email@example.com
mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
AuthUser=your-smtp-username
AuthPass=your-smtp-password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=YES
```

### Step 2: Create PHP Scripts for Email and Verification

#### (A) `send_verification.php`: Generate a Verification Link

This script will generate a unique token and send a verification link to the user's email.

```php
<?php
// Configurations
$user_email = 'user@example.com';
$verification_url = "http://yourdomain.com/verify.php?token=";
$token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // Generate a secure random token

// Save the token to a temporary file or database (not shown for simplicity)
file_put_contents("/tmp/ssh_token_$user_email", $token);

// Send the verification email using `ssmtp`
$subject = "SSH Login Verification";
$message = "Click the link to verify your login: $verification_url$token";
$headers = "From: no-reply@yourdomain.com\r\n";

mail($user_email, $subject, $message, $headers);
echo "Verification email sent.\n";
?>
```

#### (B) `verify.php`: Verify the Token and Enable Access

This script should be hosted on a web server that the user can access. It will check the token and, if valid, grant SSH access.

```php
<?php
// Get token from the URL
$token = $_GET['token'];
$user_email = 'user@example.com';  // Replace with dynamic user handling if needed

// Validate the token by checking the stored file or database
$stored_token = file_get_contents("/tmp/ssh_token_$user_email");

if ($token === $stored_token) {
    // Allow SSH by writing a flag
    file_put_contents("/tmp/ssh_verified_$user_email", "verified");

    echo "Verification successful. You can now log in via SSH.";
} else {
    echo "Invalid or expired token.";
}
?>
```

### Step 3: Configure SSH with ForceCommand to Check Verification

In the user's SSH configuration, use the `ForceCommand` option in the `sshd_config` file to run a script that checks if the user is verified.

Add the following line to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```conf
Match User <username>
    ForceCommand /path/to/verify_ssh.sh
```

#### `verify_ssh.sh`: Script to Check Verification Status

This script will check if the user has verified their email before allowing access.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the path to the verification file
USER_EMAIL="user@example.com"
VERIFICATION_FILE="/tmp/ssh_verified_$USER_EMAIL"

# Check if the verification file exists
if [[ -f "$VERIFICATION_FILE" ]]; then
    # Remove verification file to prevent reuse
    rm "$VERIFICATION_FILE"

    # Proceed with user's shell
    exec "$SHELL"
else
    # Deny access if verification is missing
    echo "Please verify your email to gain SSH access."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Summary

1. When a user tries to log in, SSH triggers `verify_ssh.sh` through `ForceCommand`.
2. The `verify_ssh.sh` script checks if the user has verified their email.
3. If verified, it runs the user's shell; if not, it denies access.

### Important Notes

- **Security**: This setup is for educational or internal purposes only. Email-based authentication can be spoofed or intercepted.
- **Production Use**: Consider using a secure authentication method, such as two-factor authentication or public-key-based login, rather than email-based verification for SSH access.
- **Clean Up**: Ensure temporary files are properly handled to avoid reuse vulnerabilities.

This configuration is a high-level example and may require further customization depending on your specific environment and security policies.

To configure SSH login via email link click verification with access to `$SHELL`, `ssmtp` (Simple SMTP), and `.sh` files with the use of `ForceCommand` and a browser for the email link, you need to implement several components. Here's an overview and code snippets for setting up this kind of environment.

### 1. Prerequisites:
- Install necessary packages:
  - **SSH**: Ensure SSH is installed and properly configured.
  - **ssmtp**: Lightweight email sending tool for sending verification links.
  - **ForceCommand**: To restrict SSH login to a custom command.
  - **A web server**: For handling email link verification.
  
### 2. SSH Configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):

You need to set up `ForceCommand` in your `sshd_config` to enforce that each login is verified via a custom script (e.g., to send and handle the email verification process).

```bash
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# ForceCommand to execute a custom script for login verification
ForceCommand /path/to/verify_login.sh

# Permit empty passwords if using email link (you can modify this for better security)
PermitEmptyPasswords yes

# Allow authentication using keys or other methods
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

### 3. `verify_login.sh` Script:
This script will handle email link generation and redirect to a browser for verification.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# /path/to/verify_login.sh

# Step 1: Generate a one-time verification token
VERIFICATION_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Step 2: Send email with verification link using ssmtp
echo "To: user@example.com
Subject: SSH Login Verification
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Please click on the link to verify your login:
https://yourserver.com/verify?token=$VERIFICATION_TOKEN" | ssmtp user@example.com

# Step 3: Inform user of verification process
echo "A verification link has been sent to your email. Please click the link to continue."

# Step 4: Wait for user to verify (you can implement a timeout if needed)
while [ ! -f /tmp/$VERIFICATION_TOKEN ]; do
  sleep 1
done

# Step 5: Allow access to $SHELL
exec $SHELL
```

### 4. Handling Email Link Verification:
On your web server, create a script to handle the link click verification.

#### Example `verify.php` (on your web server):

```php
<?php
// /var/www/html/verify.php

if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];

    // Check if the token is valid
    if (file_exists("/tmp/$token")) {
        echo "Verification successful! You can now log in.";
        
        // Create the file to signal SSH that verification is complete
        touch("/tmp/$token");
    } else {
        echo "Invalid or expired token.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>
```

This script will be accessible by the user when they click the verification link in their email.

### 5. Configuring `ssmtp` (`/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`):
You need to configure `ssmtp` to send the verification email using your mail server.

```bash
# /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.yourmailserver.com:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
```

This configuration will allow `ssmtp` to send emails from your server. Replace the relevant details like `smtp.yourmailserver.com` and the authentication credentials with your own.

### 6. Final Setup:
- **Ensure your script is executable**:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /path/to/verify_login.sh
  ```

- **Restart SSH service** to apply changes:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```

### 7. Security Considerations:
- Make sure to use `HTTPS` for email verification links to protect the token.
- Implement a token expiration mechanism to prevent indefinite access.
- The above setup allows users to log in only if they have clicked the verification link, effectively providing an email-based login mechanism.

### Summary:
1. Configure SSH with `ForceCommand` to use a custom script for verification.
2. The `verify_login.sh` script generates a token and sends it via `ssmtp`.
3. The user clicks the link in the email, which triggers a verification script on your web server.
4. Once verified, a file is created, and access to `$SHELL` is allowed.

This solution requires additional web server setup and proper token management, but it integrates SSH login with an email link-based verification process.

To set up SSH login via email link click verification, including `$SHELL` access, `ssmtp.conf`, and `.sh` files, with the use of `ForceCommand` and a browser for the verification process, the approach involves multiple steps. This process will utilize an email verification system to provide an additional layer of security for SSH access. Below is the full implementation:

### Steps Overview:
1. **Configure SSH server for email-based verification.**
2. **Set up the email configuration (`ssmtp.conf`).**
3. **Write the verification shell script (`.sh` files).**
4. **ForceCommand to execute verification script.**
5. **Implement a basic browser-based verification process.**

### Step 1: Configure SSH Server (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)
Edit the SSH server configuration to ensure that users must run the verification shell script on login.

```bash
# Open SSH configuration file
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# ForceCommand to specify a script that should be executed on login
ForceCommand /path/to/verify.sh

# Ensure PasswordAuthentication is disabled for added security
PasswordAuthentication no

# Restart SSH service
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 2: Configure Email Client (`/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`)
Set up `ssmtp` to send email with a verification link to users. Here’s how to configure `ssmtp.conf`:

```bash
# Open ssmtp configuration file
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

# Configuration for your email provider (example with Gmail)
root=your_email@gmail.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
hostname=your_domain.com
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=your_email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_password
FromLineOverride=YES
```

> **Important**: Ensure you use an app-specific password for Gmail if you have two-factor authentication enabled.

### Step 3: Write the Verification Shell Script (`verify.sh`)
The verification script will generate a unique verification link and send it via email to the user. After clicking the link, they can be logged into the server.

#### Example `verify.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables for verification
USER_EMAIL="$1"  # User email passed as argument
VERIFICATION_LINK="http://yourdomain.com/verify?token=$(uuidgen)"  # Generate a unique token

# Send the email with the verification link
echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Verification\n\nPlease click the following link to verify your SSH login:\n\n$VERIFICATION_LINK" | ssmtp "$USER_EMAIL"

# Inform the user that a verification email has been sent
echo "A verification email has been sent to your email address. Please check your inbox."

# Wait for verification (you can add more logic here to verify the link)
while true; do
  # Check if the verification token is valid (e.g., by checking a web service or database)
  if verify_token_in_database "$VERIFICATION_LINK"; then
    break  # Exit loop and allow SSH login
  fi
  sleep 5
done

# Allow access to the shell once verified
exec $SHELL
```

#### Notes:
- The script generates a verification token and sends the link to the provided email.
- `verify_token_in_database` should be a function that checks if the verification token is valid, either by querying a database or web service.
- Once verified, it proceeds with SSH access.

### Step 4: Web Server for Link Validation
You'll need a web service to handle the verification link when clicked by the user. This can be a simple PHP, Node.js, or Python Flask application.

#### Example PHP Script (for simplicity):
Create a simple PHP script to handle the verification:

```php
<?php
// Simple PHP verification script

if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];

    // Here you can check if the token is valid (e.g., by querying a database)
    if (is_valid_token($token)) {
        echo "Verification successful! You can now log in via SSH.";
        // Mark the token as verified in your database
    } else {
        echo "Invalid verification token.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}

function is_valid_token($token) {
    // Example: Check if the token exists in the database
    // Replace this with actual database logic
    return true;
}
?>
```

### Step 5: Force SSH Command and `$SHELL` Access
Make sure that SSH only runs the `verify.sh` script and prevents users from accessing the system shell directly without verification. This is done by setting `ForceCommand` in the SSH configuration.

### Example Shell Access (`.sh` File)
Once the user is verified, you can allow them access to the shell as usual.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The user has been verified; proceed with shell access
echo "Verification successful. Welcome to the system!"
exec /bin/bash  # Or any shell you want to use
```

### Step 6: Additional Security Measures
- **Token Expiry**: You should add token expiration logic for security reasons (e.g., tokens expire after 10 minutes).
- **Database/Token Storage**: Store tokens securely in a database to ensure they can be validated effectively.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure that your web verification page uses HTTPS to prevent token interception.

### Conclusion
This setup allows SSH access via email-based verification by sending a link with a unique token. Upon clicking the link, the user is verified, and access to the shell is granted. The `ForceCommand` ensures that no user can bypass the verification step. The use of `ssmtp` helps send the verification email securely.

To configure SSH login via an email link click verification with access to `$SHELL`, along with configuring `ssmtp` and `.sh` files, including a `ForceCommand` directive in the `sshd_config` file, follow the steps below.

We'll break it down into:

1. **Configure `ssmtp` for sending the email verification link.**
2. **Set up the `sshd_config` for SSH login with `ForceCommand`.**
3. **Create a script for handling the SSH login verification via a link.**
4. **Ensure proper setup of `.sh` files to handle the full flow.**

### Step 1: Configure `ssmtp` for Sending the Email Verification Link

First, we’ll configure `ssmtp` to send email notifications with a login verification link.

1. **Install `ssmtp`**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ssmtp
   ```

2. **Configure `ssmtp` in `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`**:
   Here’s an example configuration for Gmail:

   ```bash
   root=postmaster
   mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
   AuthUser=your-email@gmail.com
   AuthPass=your-email-password
   UseTLS=YES
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   FromLineOverride=YES
   ```

   Replace `your-email@gmail.com` and `your-email-password` with your actual credentials. **Warning:** Avoid plain-text passwords; use app passwords if possible, especially for services like Gmail.

### Step 2: Configure `sshd_config` for SSH with `ForceCommand`

To enforce a verification process during SSH login, we need to modify the `sshd_config` file to run a custom script.

1. **Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`**:
   
   Add these lines at the end:

   ```bash
   ForceCommand /path/to/verification.sh
   AllowUsers your-username
   PermitEmptyPasswords no
   ```

   Here, `/path/to/verification.sh` will be the script to handle the verification. Replace `your-username` with the username you intend to use.

2. **Restart SSH service**:
   
   After modifying the config, restart the SSH service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Verification Script (`verification.sh`)

The idea is that when a user logs in via SSH, a verification script runs. This script will:

1. Send an email with a link for the user to click.
2. Wait for the click (this will simulate a process).
3. Once clicked, allow the user to access the shell.

Here is a sample script:

#### `/path/to/verification.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a random verification code
verification_code=$(openssl rand -base64 12)

# Send the email with the verification code and link
email_subject="SSH Login Verification"
email_body="Click the link to verify your login: https://example.com/verify?code=$verification_code"
echo -e "Subject:$email_subject\n\n$email_body" | ssmtp recipient-email@example.com

# Output the message to the user about the verification email
echo "A verification email has been sent. Please check your inbox and click the verification link to continue."

# Wait for the user to verify
while true; do
    # Here we simulate a process to wait for the user to verify via the link
    # In a real-world setup, this could involve checking a database or API for the verification status.
    
    # Simulate the check by waiting for a process or file change indicating verification
    sleep 10  # This could be replaced with actual verification logic
done

# Once verified, proceed to shell access
exec /bin/bash  # This will give the user access to their shell
```

In this script:

- The user receives an email with a verification link.
- The script loops, simulating the waiting process (this could be a real check against a verification endpoint).
- Once verified (e.g., by clicking the link), the user is given access to the shell.

### Step 4: Handling `.sh` Files for Verification Process

You can store additional logic in `.sh` files for specific tasks or to enhance the verification process.

For example:

#### `/path/to/verify.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assuming we check the verification status
# For simplicity, this is a placeholder for a real check

if [ "$1" == "correct_verification_code" ]; then
    echo "Verification successful."
    exit 0
else
    echo "Invalid code."
    exit 1
fi
```

In this example, the `verify.sh` script simulates the verification process where a correct code is checked. You would call this from the main `verification.sh` script after receiving the user’s verification input.

### Additional Notes:

- **Security Considerations**: Do not store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Consider using secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, JWT) for email or code verification.
- **Web Server**: If using a web link for the verification (`https://example.com/verify?code=$verification_code`), ensure your server is properly configured to handle these requests and verify the code.
- **Handling Multiple Users**: If you want to handle multiple users, ensure the verification code is unique per session and stored securely.

This is a basic implementation of SSH login via email verification and ForceCommand in `sshd_config`. Depending on your environment and specific needs, you may want to refine the approach further.

This approach involves utilizing a custom script to generate an email link, which the user clicks to authenticate, and some modifications to the SSH configuration for proper security.

Below is a step-by-step guide, including all necessary files and configurations:

### 1. **Configure SSH Server (`sshd_config`)**
Modify your `sshd_config` file to enforce the use of a custom `ForceCommand` and disable password authentication.

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
# Disable password authentication
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

# Force the use of the custom verification script for login
ForceCommand /path/to/your/verify_login.sh
```

This will ensure that SSH login attempts invoke the `verify_login.sh` script instead of providing shell access directly.

After editing the `sshd_config` file, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### 2. **Create the Verification Script (`verify_login.sh`)**
This script will handle the login verification process, send an email with a clickable link to the user, and provide `$SHELL` access after the verification is successful.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the user's email address and generate a unique token for verification
USER_EMAIL="user@example.com"  # Replace with the actual email address
VERIFICATION_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)  # Generates a unique token
VERIFICATION_URL="https://yourdomain.com/verify?token=$VERIFICATION_TOKEN"  # Replace with your actual verification URL

# Store the token temporarily (e.g., in a file or database)
echo $VERIFICATION_TOKEN > /tmp/verification_token.txt

# Send the email with the verification link using ssmtp
echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Verification\n\nClick the following link to complete your SSH login: $VERIFICATION_URL" | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL

# Prompt the user to wait for email verification
echo "A verification link has been sent to $USER_EMAIL. Please check your inbox and click the link to complete the login process."

# Wait for the user to click the verification link (you can check for token verification here)
# This part can be more sophisticated based on your server setup
while [ ! -f /tmp/verification_complete.txt ]; do
    sleep 5
done

# If verification is successful, grant access
echo "Verification successful. Granting access to $USER_EMAIL."
exec /bin/bash  # Allow access to the shell after verification

```

Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/verify_login.sh
```

### 3. **Configure the `ssmtp.conf` for Sending Emails**
You'll need a working `ssmtp` configuration to send emails from your server. Edit `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to configure your email sending.

Example configuration:

```bash
# /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.yourmailserver.com:587  # Replace with your SMTP server
AuthUser=your_email@example.com      # Your email address
AuthPass=your_email_password         # Your email password
FromLineOverride=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

Ensure that the `ssmtp` service is installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```

### 4. **Create a Web Verification Endpoint**
For the clickable link in the email to work, you'll need a web server that can handle the token verification. This could be done with a simple PHP script or a custom web application.

Example PHP script (`verify.php`):

```php
<?php
$token = $_GET['token'];  // Get token from URL

// Validate the token (check if it matches the one sent via email)
$stored_token = file_get_contents("/tmp/verification_token.txt");  // Read the stored token

if ($token == $stored_token) {
    // Mark the verification as successful
    file_put_contents("/tmp/verification_complete.txt", "verified");

    // Redirect the user to a success page or return a response
    echo "Verification successful! You can now return to your SSH session.";
} else {
    echo "Invalid verification link.";
}
?>
```

### 5. **Setup Browser Access and Final Flow**
Ensure the browser server is accessible via `https://yourdomain.com/verify.php`. The user clicks on the email link to complete the verification.

- After verification, the script marks the process as complete by creating the `/tmp/verification_complete.txt` file, which the SSH verification script (`verify_login.sh`) checks to allow the user access to the shell.
- Upon successful verification, the user is granted access to `$SHELL` through the `exec /bin/bash` command in the `verify_login.sh`.

### 6. **Final Notes**
- Ensure your server can send and receive email using `ssmtp` properly configured.
- Set up a secure HTTPS server for handling the verification link.
- The verification process can be extended with token expiration or more advanced security checks.
  
This setup should provide SSH login via email verification, shell access, and a seamless experience for the user, using the provided scripts and configurations.

To configure SSH login via email link click verification (two-factor authentication via a link sent to an email), incorporating `$SHELL` access, `ssmtp.conf`, and `.sh` files (for scripts), and forcing the command with `ForceCommand` and browser, we need to address multiple aspects.

The setup will involve:

1. **SSH Configuration** to force specific commands.
2. **Email Sending Mechanism** via `ssmtp`.
3. **Shell Script** that handles the email verification and forces specific commands.

I'll break it down step-by-step.

### 1. **SSH Server Configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)**

We need to configure SSH to force the execution of specific commands and ensure the correct authentication. Add the following to your `sshd_config` file to enforce the command (e.g., the script to check the verification):

```bash
# Enforce the use of a specific script with ForceCommand
ForceCommand /path/to/verify_email.sh
AllowTcpForwarding no
PermitTTY yes
```

This ensures that every SSH login will trigger the execution of the script `verify_email.sh`.

### 2. **The Email Verification Script (`verify_email.sh`)**

This script will handle the email verification part. It will send an email with a unique verification link to the user, which they must click to authenticate. The script will check if the user has clicked the link and proceed accordingly.

#### `verify_email.sh`:

```bash
  #!/bin/bash

# Define a unique token for verification
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
USER_EMAIL="$1"  # Assumes email is passed to the script via SSH command line

# Create a temporary file to track the token
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/verification"
mkdir -p $TEMP_DIR
echo $TOKEN > "$TEMP_DIR/$USER_EMAIL.token"

# Send email with the verification link
VERIFICATION_URL="https://yourserver.com/verify?token=$TOKEN"
echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Verification\n\nClick the link to verify your SSH login: $VERIFICATION_URL" | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL

# Wait for user to verify (by clicking the link, ideally with a server-side handler)
echo "Waiting for verification..."
while true; do
    if [ -f "$TEMP_DIR/$USER_EMAIL.verified" ]; then
        echo "Email verified, continuing SSH session."
        break
    fi
    sleep 5
done

# Provide the user with shell access
exec $SHELL

```

This script generates a verification token and sends it via email using `ssmtp`. The user will have to click the verification link. The script checks if a file named `.verified` exists to confirm the user has verified via the link.

### 3. **`ssmtp.conf` Configuration**

The `ssmtp` utility will send the email. You'll need to configure it with your mail provider.

#### `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`:

```bash
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.yourmailprovider.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=YES
```

This configuration ensures that `ssmtp` uses your email credentials to send the verification email.

### 4. **Web Verification Handler**

You also need a web server to handle the verification link (e.g., a simple web server or PHP script) that will create the `.verified` file.

#### Example: PHP Verification Handler (`verify.php`)

This is a very simple PHP script that listens for the token and creates the verification file:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['token']) && !empty($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    
    // Ensure you validate the token properly (to avoid attacks)
    $email = "user@example.com";  // Retrieve the correct email based on token (you'll need a mapping)
    $file_path = "/tmp/verification/$email.token";
    
    if (file_exists($file_path) && file_get_contents($file_path) === $token) {
        touch("/tmp/verification/$email.verified");
        echo "Email verified successfully!";
    } else {
        echo "Invalid token.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>
```

This script checks the token from the URL, verifies it, and creates the `.verified` file for the user. Ensure that the email-to-token mapping is correctly implemented for security.

### 5. **Testing and Adjustments**

- **Test the complete flow**: Ensure the user can log in, receive an email, click the verification link, and then get access to the shell.
- **Security considerations**: You should secure the token validation process, ensuring it's unique per session and properly validated.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the SSH user has the proper permissions to execute scripts and access `$SHELL`.

### 6. **Browser Handling**

The browser will be used to click the link, so there’s no need for any specific browser-side handling beyond the simple PHP script.

---

### Notes:
- This setup assumes that you have a basic web server with PHP installed to handle the token verification process.
- You may want to integrate more robust email validation or token expiration checks to ensure the security of the verification process.
