Implementing email link click authentication for SSH using a combination of `ForceCommand`, a custom script, and email generation involves several steps. This approach requires SSH to execute a specific command when a user connects, and that command includes authentication via a link sent to their email. Here’s a detailed guide to achieving this:

### Step 1: Setup Email Sending with `ssmtp`

1. **Install `ssmtp`:**
   Ensure that `ssmtp` is installed on your server. You can install it using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ssmtp
   ```

2. **Configure `ssmtp`:**
   Configure the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` file for your SMTP server. For example:

   ```plaintext
   root=postmaster
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   ```

3. **Set Up Email Sending Script:**
   Create a script that sends an email with a unique link. Here’s an example script (`send_auth_email.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   EMAIL="$1"
   AUTH_CODE="$(openssl rand -hex 12)"
   LINK="http://yourdomain.com/authenticate?code=$AUTH_CODE"

   echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate your SSH session: $LINK" | ssmtp "$EMAIL"

   # Store AUTH_CODE and associate it with the user
   #echo "$AUTH_CODE" > "/tmp/auth_code_$USER"
   # echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo tee "/tmp/auth_code_$USER" > /dev/null
   #echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo tee "/tmp/auth_code_root" > /dev/null
   #echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo tee "/tmp/auth_code_root" > /dev/null && sudo chmod +x /tmp/auth_code_root
    echo "$AUTH_CODE" | sudo -u <username> tee "/tmp/auth_code_root" > /dev/null && sudo chmod +x /tmp/auth_code_root && chmod 644 /tmp/auth_code_root
   
   
   ```

   Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x send_auth_email.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Create the Authentication Script

This script will handle the authentication when the user clicks the link.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# auth_link.sh
AUTH_CODE="$1"
USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE="/tmp/auth_code_$USER"

# Debugging: Check if file exists
echo "Looking for auth code file: $USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE"

# Create a test auth code if the file doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Creating auth code file with a test code."
    echo "12345" > "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE"
fi

# Check if the code matches the stored one
if [ -f "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE" ]; then
    STORED_CODE="$(cat $USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE)"
    if [ "$AUTH_CODE" == "$STORED_CODE" ]; then
        echo "Authentication successful."
        rm "$USER_AUTH_CODE_FILE"  # Cleanup
        exec $SHELL  # Open a shell session
    else
        echo "Authentication failed."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "No authentication code found."
    exit 1
fi

```

Make this script executable:

```bash
chmod +x auth_link.sh
```

### Step 3: Update SSH Configuration

1. **Edit SSHD Configuration:**
   Open your SSH daemon configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and add or modify the following line:

   ```plaintext
   ForceCommand /path/to/send_auth_email.sh $USER; exec /path/to/auth_link.sh
   ```

   Ensure to replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to your scripts.

2. **Set Up the Shell Environment:**
   In the same configuration file, set the default shell to your desired shell if needed:

   ```plaintext
   Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
   ```

### Step 4: Create the Link Handling Mechanism

You'll need a web server to handle the GET request from the link that the user clicks. Here’s a simple example using PHP:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['code'])) {
    $code = $_GET['code'];
    // Call the authentication script with the code
    $output = shell_exec("/path/to/auth_link.sh $code 2>&1");
    echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
} else {
    echo "No code provided.";
}
?>
```

### Step 5: Restart SSH Service

After configuring everything, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Final Considerations

- **Security:** Ensure your scripts are secured and only accessible to authorized users.
- **Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up expired or used authentication codes.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire workflow to ensure users can authenticate smoothly.
- **Logging:** Consider adding logging for both successful and failed authentication attempts.

This setup combines SSH with email authentication, adding a layer of security for remote access.

To implement email-based link-click authentication for SSH access using `ForceCommand`, you can combine several tools and steps, including generating an authentication email, creating a custom script to verify authentication, and utilizing `ForceCommand` to control the SSH session. Here’s an outline of how you can set this up on a Linux server:

### Prerequisites

1. **ssmtp (or another email-sending tool)**: To send emails.
2. **A web server**: To host the authentication link.
3. **A custom shell script**: To verify the authentication link.
4. **SSH ForceCommand**: To control SSH command execution.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Set Up `ssmtp` (or Similar) to Send Emails

Install `ssmtp` and configure it to work with an email provider (e.g., Gmail, Postfix, etc.). If `ssmtp` is not suitable for your needs, you could also use `sendmail` or `mail`.

Example configuration for `ssmtp`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```

Configure `ssmtp` by editing `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`:
```conf
root=username@gmail.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthUser=username@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

#### 2. Create the Custom Authentication Script

This script will generate a unique token for each SSH session and send it as part of a clickable link in an email.

- Create a directory for temporary tokens, like `/tmp/auth_tokens/`.
- Create a custom script, `auth_check.sh`, to generate the link and send an email with the token.

Here's an example of `auth_check.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
EMAIL="user@example.com"  # Email to send the link
TOKEN_FILE="/tmp/auth_tokens"
TOKEN=$(uuidgen)  # Generate a unique token
URL="http://yourserver.com/verify?token=$TOKEN"  # Verification URL

# Store the token in a file with the user's name
#echo "$TOKEN" > "$TOKEN_FILE/${USER}.token"
 echo "$TOKEN" | tee "/tmp/auth_tokens/$USER.token" > /dev/null


# Send an email with the token link using ssmtp
echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate:\n$URL" | ssmtp "$EMAIL"

echo "An authentication link has been sent to your email. Please click the link to complete the SSH login."
echo "Waiting for authentication..."

# Wait for the file to be updated or deleted as a sign of authentication
while [ -f "$TOKEN_FILE/${USER}.token" ]; do
  sleep 1
done

# If the file is deleted, authentication succeeded
echo "Authentication successful. Welcome!"
exec $SHELL  # Proceed to the user's shell
```

#### 3. Configure the Web Server to Verify the Token

Set up a simple server-side script (like in PHP or Python) to delete the token file when the user clicks the link. For example, a PHP script `verify.php` could look like this:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    $user_token_file = "/tmp/auth_tokens/{$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']}.token";

    // Debug: Output token and file path
    echo "Token from URL: " . htmlspecialchars($token) . "<br>";
    echo "File path: " . htmlspecialchars($user_token_file) . "<br>";
    
    if (file_exists($user_token_file)) {
        $file_token = trim(file_get_contents($user_token_file));
        echo "Token from file: " . htmlspecialchars($file_token) . "<br>";
        
        if ($file_token === $token) {
            unlink($user_token_file);
            echo "Authentication successful!";
        } else {
            echo "Invalid or expired token.";
        }
    } else {
        echo "Token file does not exist.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>

```

Place `verify.php` on your web server and ensure it’s accessible at the URL defined in `auth_check.sh`.

#### 4. Set Up `ForceCommand` in SSH Configuration

Configure SSH to use `ForceCommand` to run the authentication script `auth_check.sh` whenever a user logs in.

1. Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
2. Add a `ForceCommand` entry for the users who need email link-click authentication. For example:

```conf
Match User your_ssh_user
    ForceCommand /path/to/auth_check.sh
```

3. Reload SSH to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

### How It Works

1. When the specified user logs in over SSH, `ForceCommand` runs `auth_check.sh`.
2. `auth_check.sh` generates a token, saves it, and sends an email with a verification link.
3. The user clicks the link in their email, triggering the server-side script (`verify.php`), which deletes the token file if the token is valid.
4. `auth_check.sh` detects the file deletion and grants access by launching the user’s default shell.

### Important Security Considerations

- **SSL**: Ensure your web server uses HTTPS to protect token transmission.
- **Permissions**: Restrict permissions for `/tmp/auth_tokens` and the scripts to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Token Expiration**: Consider implementing a timeout mechanism in `auth_check.sh` to delete stale tokens.

With this setup, users must verify each SSH session via email link click, adding an extra layer of security.

Implementing email-based link-click authentication for SSH access using `ForceCommand` involves several steps. Below is a guide on how to set up this system, including generating an authentication email, creating a custom script to verify the authentication link, and utilizing `ForceCommand` to control the SSH session.

### Prerequisites

1. **SSMTP or equivalent**: Ensure that you have a mail transfer agent (like `ssmtp`, `msmtp`, or `sendmail`) configured to send emails from your server.
2. **SSH Server**: Have an SSH server (like OpenSSH) installed and configured on your system.

### Steps to Implement Email-Based Link-Click Authentication

#### 1. Set Up SSMTP

First, configure `ssmtp` to send emails. Edit the configuration file, typically found at `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`, with the necessary SMTP server details.

```bash
# /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.your-email-provider.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
UseSTARTTLS=YES
UseTLS=YES
```

#### 2. Generate Authentication Email

Create a script that generates a unique authentication token, saves it, and sends an email with a link to that token.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# auth_email.sh
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
USER=$(echo $1)  # Get the username

# Save the token and username to a file or database
echo "$USER:$TOKEN" >> /tmp/auth_tokens.txt

# Create the authentication link
LINK="http://yourserver.com/authenticate.php?token=$TOKEN&user=$USER"

# Send the email
echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate your SSH session:" $LINK | ssmtp $USER
```

Make sure this script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x auth_email.sh
```

#### 3. Create the Verification Script

Create a script that verifies the token when clicked.

```php
<?php
// authenticate.php
session_start();
$user = $_GET['user'];
$token = $_GET['token'];

// Read the tokens file
$tokens = file('/tmp/auth_tokens.txt', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES | FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES);
foreach ($tokens as $line) {
    list($lineUser, $lineToken) = explode(':', $line);
    if ($lineUser === $user && $lineToken === $token) {
        // Token is valid, log the user in
        $_SESSION['authenticated_user'] = $user;
        // Remove the token from the file
        unset($tokens[array_search($line, $tokens)]);
        file_put_contents('/tmp/auth_tokens.txt', implode("\n", $tokens));
        echo "Authenticated. You can now access the SSH.";
        exit;
    }
}
echo "Invalid token.";
?>
```

#### 4. Use `ForceCommand` in SSH Configuration

Modify your `sshd_config` file (usually located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to set up `ForceCommand` to use your verification script.

```bash
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /path/to/verify_auth.sh
```

#### 5. Create the Verification Script for SSH

Create a script that will check if the user is authenticated.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# verify_auth.sh
if [[ -z "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]; then
    echo "SSH connection not established."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the user is authenticated
if [[ -z "$USER" || ! -f /tmp/auth_tokens.txt ]]; then
    echo "Not authenticated. Please check your email for the authentication link."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the session is authenticated
if grep -q "$USER" /tmp/auth_tokens.txt; then
    echo "Authenticated. You can now access the shell."
    exec $SHELL  # Replace with the user's shell
else
    echo "Authentication failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
chmod +x verify_auth.sh
```

#### 6. Restart SSH Service

After making changes to the SSH configuration, restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Conclusion

With this setup:

1. When a user tries to SSH, they will be prompted to check their email for an authentication link.
2. Clicking the link will authenticate the user, removing the token from the file to prevent reuse.
3. If authenticated, the user gains access to their shell.

### Important Security Considerations

- Ensure secure handling of tokens and user data.
- Regularly clean the `/tmp/auth_tokens.txt` file to remove expired tokens.
- Consider using HTTPS for your web server to secure the authentication link.

This is a basic implementation; you may want to extend it with additional security measures, such as logging, token expiration, and more robust session management.

        $_SESSION['authenticated_user'] = $user;

        // Regenerate session ID to prevent session fixation
        session_regenerate_id(true);

        // Remove the token from the file
        unset($tokens[array_search($line, $tokens)]);
        
        // Write the updated token list back to the file
        if (file_put_contents($tokensFile, implode("\n", $tokens) . "\n") === false) {
            echo "Error updating token file.";
            exit;
        }

        echo "Authenticated. You can now access the SSH.";
        exit;
    }
}

echo "Invalid token.";
?>

To set up SSH login via an email link verification system and use `ForcedCommand` with `$SHELL` access, you can implement a solution by integrating several components. Here's an outline of how you can achieve this:

### 1. **SSH ForcedCommand Configuration**
   The `ForcedCommand` option in the SSH configuration forces the server to execute a specific command for every login, regardless of what the user attempts to run. In your case, we will configure it to allow the user to log in only if they pass a secondary email verification process.

   **Steps:**
   - Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the server.
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - Add the following lines:
     ```
     Match User * 
         ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/verify_ssh_login.sh
         AllowTcpForwarding no
         X11Forwarding no
     ```
     This will ensure that every user triggers the `verify_ssh_login.sh` script on login.

### 2. **Email Verification Process**
   You'll need a system to send an email with a unique verification link that the user must click before proceeding with SSH login. This involves setting up a mechanism to generate a one-time link and then checking the link when the user logs in.

   **Steps:**
   - **Install SSMTP (or an SMTP client):**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ssmtp
     ```
   - **Configure your email client:**
     Edit the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to configure the outgoing mail server (you may use Gmail's SMTP server or any other service).
     Example configuration for Gmail:
     ```ini
     root=postmaster@gmail.com
     mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
     AuthUser=your_email@gmail.com
     AuthPass=your_password
     FromLineOverride=YES
     UseSTARTTLS=YES
     ```
   - **Create the verification script:**
     You'll need a custom script to generate a one-time login token and send it to the user via email.

     Here's a sample script (`/usr/local/bin/verify_ssh_login.sh`):

     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     # verify_ssh_login.sh
     
     # Assume the username is the email
     USER_EMAIL="$USER@example.com"
     LOGIN_TOKEN=$(uuidgen)
     VERIFICATION_LINK="https://your-domain.com/verify?token=$LOGIN_TOKEN"

     # Store the token in a temporary file or database
     echo "$LOGIN_TOKEN $USER_EMAIL" > /tmp/ssh_login_tokens.txt

     # Send the email
     echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Verification\n\nPlease click the link to verify your login: $VERIFICATION_LINK" | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL
     
     echo "A verification link has been sent to your email. Please click it to complete the login."
     exit 1  # Prevent login until the verification link is clicked
     ```

   - **Set execute permissions for the script:**
     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/verify_ssh_login.sh
     ```

### 3. **Web Interface for Verification Link**
   Create a web page that the user can visit by clicking the link in their email. This web page will verify the token and then allow the user to continue with their SSH session.

   **Steps:**
   - Set up a simple web server (for example, Apache, Nginx, or any server of your choice) to handle the verification page.
   - The script should check the token against the list of generated tokens (`/tmp/ssh_login_tokens.txt` or a database).
   - After the user clicks the verification link, the server should delete the token from the list, allowing the SSH session to continue.

   **Example PHP verification page (verification.php):**
   ```php
   <?php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    $file = '/tmp/ssh_login_tokens.txt';

    // Check if file exists
    if (file_exists($file)) {
        $tokens = file($file, FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES);
        $isVerified = false;

        foreach ($tokens as $index => $line) {
            list($stored_token, $user_email) = explode(' ', $line);

            // Compare the token
            if ($stored_token == $token) {
                // Token is valid, proceed with the process (e.g., mark as verified)
                unset($tokens[$index]); // Remove the verified token

                // Update the file
                file_put_contents($file, implode("\n", $tokens));

                echo "Verification successful. You may now return to your SSH session.";
                $isVerified = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!$isVerified) {
            echo "Invalid token.";
        }
    } else {
        echo "Token file not found.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>

   ```

### 4. **Finalizing SSH Login Process**
   - After the user clicks the verification link, the `verify_ssh_login.sh` script will allow the SSH session to proceed. You may use a flag or update the status in a file to indicate the user has successfully verified their login.

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   if [ ! -f /tmp/ssh_login_verified_$USER ]; then
       echo "Please verify your login by clicking the link sent to your email."
       exit 1
   fi

   # Allow login
   exec $SHELL
   ```

### Summary
This solution requires:
1. Configuring SSH `ForcedCommand` to run a verification script.
2. Sending a verification email with a unique token using `ssmtp`.
3. Providing a verification link for the user to click.
4. Setting up a web server to verify the token and update the login status.

This provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that users cannot log in without verifying their email first.

To set up SSH login via email link verification, with the forced command and email features like `ssmtp` or `php`, you'd typically follow these general steps:

### Overview of the Process:
1. **User Initiates SSH Login**: The user attempts to log in via SSH.
2. **Email Verification**: An email with a login link is sent to the user's registered email address.
3. **Forced Command Setup**: Once the user clicks the link, SSH access is granted with a restricted environment using the `forcedcommand` directive.
4. **$SHELL and Access Codes**: The server returns the user's shell or a custom shell based on the login script execution.

### Prerequisites:
- **Email System**: You need a mail system (like `ssmtp` or `sendmail`) installed and configured to send emails.
- **PHP**: You’ll need PHP installed to handle dynamic link generation and email sending.
- **SSH Setup**: Ensure SSH is configured to support forced commands and user verification.

### Steps:

#### 1. **Install Required Packages**:
Make sure the required tools are installed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp sendmail php openssh-server
```

#### 2. **Configure Mail System (ssmtp or sendmail)**:
- For `ssmtp`, you will need to configure it in `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` with your SMTP server details.

Example `ssmtp.conf`:
```conf
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.your-email-provider.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

- If using `sendmail`, configure it according to your system and email provider.

#### 3. **PHP Script for Email Generation**:
Create a PHP script that generates a unique login link and sends it to the user’s email address.

```php
<?php
$email = $_POST['email'];
$login_token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));  // Create a unique token

// Store the token with the email for later verification
file_put_contents('/tmp/verification_tokens.txt', "$email:$login_token\n", FILE_APPEND);

// Generate login link
$link = "https://yourserver.com/verify.php?token=$login_token&email=$email";

// Send the email
$subject = "SSH Login Verification";
$message = "Click the following link to log in: $link";
mail($email, $subject, $message, "From: your-email@example.com");

echo "A verification email has been sent.";
?>
```

#### 4. **Verification Script (verify.php)**:
This script handles the verification when the user clicks the link.

```php
<?php
$token = $_GET['token'];
$email = $_GET['email'];

// Check if token exists in the stored list
$tokens = file('/tmp/verification_tokens.txt', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES);
foreach ($tokens as $line) {
    list($stored_email, $stored_token) = explode(':', $line);
    if ($stored_email === $email && $stored_token === $token) {
        // Token is valid, proceed with SSH login setup
        header('Location: ssh://yourserver.com');
        exit;
    }
}

echo "Invalid token.";
?>
```

#### 5. **Configure SSH with ForcedCommand**:
In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, you can configure SSH to execute a command upon successful login.

```bash
Match User yourusername
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/verify_user_login.sh
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
```

This will execute a custom script (`/usr/local/bin/verify_user_login.sh`) when the user logs in.

#### 6. **Verification Script (`verify_user_login.sh`)**:
The script verifies the login, and can enforce restrictions, including setting the user’s `$SHELL` based on their verification.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# You can add custom logic to verify the user’s login
# Example: Check for a file or a token passed

echo "Welcome to the server, $USER"

# Optionally set the user's shell based on a condition
export SHELL="/bin/bash"
```

Make sure this script is executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/verify_user_login.sh
```

#### 7. **Restart SSH Server**:
After configuring the SSH server, restart it to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### How It Works:
1. **User initiates login**: The user attempts to SSH into the server.
2. **Verification via email**: The server sends an email with a link.
3. **Link clicked**: User clicks on the email link to verify the login.
4. **SSH Forced Command**: Once the user is verified, the `ForceCommand` in SSH configuration allows a restricted command to run, allowing login with the desired shell or restricting access based on `$SHELL`.

This setup uses a combination of email verification, PHP scripts, SSH forced commands, and custom scripts to manage user access.

To set up an SSH login using an email link for verification, you can combine SSH with a verification process that sends a link to the user via email. Here’s how you can go about implementing it:

### 1. Setup a Web Server to Handle the Email Verification and SSH Authentication:
You need a system to send emails with unique links to the user that contain a verification token. Once clicked, the token should be verified, and the user can be granted access to the server via SSH.

1. **Install required packages**:
   - Ensure that `ssmtp` (or `msmtp` depending on your distro) is installed for sending emails.
   - Install PHP and a web server like Apache to serve the PHP verification scripts.

   On Ubuntu, you can install the necessary tools like this:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ssmtp msmtp php libapache2-mod-php apache2
   ```

2. **Configure ssmtp/msmtp**:
   Edit the `ssmtp` or `msmtp` configuration file to connect to your email service provider (e.g., Gmail).

   - For `msmtp`, the configuration file `/etc/msmtprc` might look like this:

     ```plaintext
     account gmail
     host smtp.gmail.com
     port 587
     from your-email@gmail.com
     user your-email@gmail.com
     password your-password
     tls on
     logfile /var/log/msmtp.log

     account default : gmail
     ```

   - For `ssmtp`, you will modify `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` similarly.

3. **PHP script to send verification email**:
   Write a PHP script that generates a unique verification link and sends it via email:

   ```php
   <?php
   $email = $_POST['email']; // user inputs email address
   $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // Generate a random token

   // Save the token to a database or flat file, associated with the user's email
   file_put_contents('/path/to/tokens.txt', "$email:$token\n", FILE_APPEND);

   $verification_link = "https://yourdomain.com/verify.php?token=$token";

   // Send verification email via msmtp or ssmtp
   mail($email, "SSH Login Verification", "Click on the following link to verify your SSH login: $verification_link");

   echo "A verification link has been sent to your email.";
   ?>
   ```

4. **Verification Script (verify.php)**:
   After the user clicks the link, the server should verify the token and allow SSH access if valid.

   ```php
   <?php
   $token = $_GET['token']; // Token from the email link
   $tokens = file('/path/to/tokens.txt');

   foreach ($tokens as $line) {
       list($email, $saved_token) = explode(':', trim($line));
       if ($saved_token == $token) {
           // Token is valid, grant SSH access
           // Here, you could set up a temporary SSH login method or log the user in
           // You can also remove or expire the token from the file after use
           echo "Token verified. You can now SSH into the server.";
           exit;
       }
   }

   echo "Invalid or expired token.";
   ?>
   ```

### 2. Enforce `ForcedCommand` in SSH:
To limit SSH access to only the validated users through this link, configure the `sshd_config` with a `ForcedCommand` that allows only specific actions (e.g., running a specific shell script after email verification):

```bash
# In /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Match User * 
    ForceCommand /path/to/verify_script.sh
```

The script could check if the user has been validated before allowing a real shell session or force a specific command.

### 3. Verification and $SHELL Access Codes Features:
Ensure the `verify_script.sh` checks for a valid token or logs the user’s session accordingly. For instance:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script checks if the user has been validated through the email link
if [[ -f "/path/to/verified_users.txt" && $(grep -q "$USER" /path/to/verified_users.txt) ]]; then
    exec $SHELL  # Allow shell access if the user is verified
else
    echo "Your verification is pending or expired."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 4. Sending Emails with PHP (`ssmtp` or `msmtp`):
Ensure the PHP `mail()` function is working by configuring the system's SMTP settings. With `ssmtp` or `msmtp` configured, emails will be sent via the configured SMTP server (Gmail, for example) to the user's email with the verification link.

---

### Security Considerations:
- **Token Expiry**: Ensure tokens have an expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes) to avoid abuse.
- **Token Storage**: Store tokens securely (in a database, not in plain text files) and hash them to improve security.
- **SSH Configuration**: Secure your SSH configuration and ensure the forced commands or scripts don't introduce security risks.

### Conclusion:
By combining PHP, SSH forced commands, and a token-based verification process, you can effectively implement an email link for SSH login verification.

Setting up SSH login via an email link verification system and using ForcedCommand with `$SHELL` access involves several steps, integrating various components such as SSH, email verification, and `ForcedCommand`. Here's a guide on how to achieve this:

### Components Involved:
1. **SSMTP**: To send email verification links.
2. **SSH**: For securing remote access to the server.
3. **ForcedCommand**: To restrict users to a specific shell or action.
4. **Email Link Verification**: A mechanism for sending a verification link to the user for authentication.

### Steps to Implement SSH Login with Email Verification and ForcedCommand

#### 1. **Install SSMTP**
First, install `ssmtp` on the server to send email via a third-party SMTP server (e.g., Gmail).

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```

#### 2. **Configure SSMTP**
Set up your SMTP configuration for sending emails. The configuration file is usually located at `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`.

Edit the `ssmtp.conf` file with your email service details:

```bash
root=postmaster
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=your-email@gmail.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
FromLineOverride=YES
```

Ensure that "Less secure apps" access is enabled in your email provider (if using Gmail, for example).

#### 3. **Create a Simple Script for Email Verification**
You can use a custom script to generate a verification link and send it via email. The script will be responsible for generating a unique token, sending the email, and then verifying it when the user tries to authenticate via SSH.

For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify-email.sh

# Generate a unique token (you can use any method you prefer for this)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Send the email with the verification link
echo "Subject: SSH Login Verification" | cat - email_body.txt | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL

# Email Body
echo "Click the link below to verify your SSH login:
https://yourserver.com/verify-token?token=$TOKEN" > email_body.txt
```

Ensure that the user will have to click the link (which sends the token to the server) to complete verification.

#### 4. **Verify the Token**
On your server, you'll need a web service or script that listens for incoming verification requests. When a user clicks the link, the server should compare the token in the URL with the one stored in a file or database.

Here’s a simple example using `nginx` and PHP:

1. Install Nginx and PHP:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nginx php-fpm
   ```

2. Configure `nginx` to handle the verification request.

   Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to include a location for the token verification endpoint.

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;

       location /verify-token {
           fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
           fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/html/verify-token.php;
           include fastcgi_params;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Create the `verify-token.php` script:

   ```php
   <?php
   if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
       $token = $_GET['token'];

       // Compare the token with the one stored (in a database or file)
       if (tokenIsValid($token)) {
           echo "Token verified!";
           // Proceed with SSH login process, allow access, or set a flag
       } else {
           echo "Invalid token.";
       }
   }

   function tokenIsValid($token) {
       // Implement your token validation logic here
       return file_get_contents('/path/to/token_file') === $token;
   }
   ?>
   ```

#### 5. **Configure SSH for ForcedCommand**
Now, you'll set up SSH to use ForcedCommand and provide access to `$SHELL`.

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following configuration:

```bash
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /path/to/your/custom-shell-script.sh
    PasswordAuthentication no
```

In your `custom-shell-script.sh`, you can include logic to check if the user has verified their email. If not, deny the login.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# custom-shell-script.sh

# Check if the user has verified their email (e.g., by checking a file or database)
if [ ! -f /path/to/user_verified ]; then
    echo "Email verification required."
    exit 1
fi

# Proceed with the default shell if verified
exec $SHELL
```

#### 6. **Finalize and Test**
1. **Restart the SSH service** to apply the configuration changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

2. **Test the entire process**:
   - The user attempts to log in via SSH.
   - The server sends a verification email with a link.
   - The user clicks the link to verify their identity.
   - After verification, the user gains access to the shell.

### Notes:
- You can modify the script to store the token in a database or file for checking.
- The `ForceCommand` option ensures that users are always executed through the shell script.
- Email services like Gmail may require additional configuration (such as app-specific passwords) for sending emails securely.

This setup should provide a basic structure for an SSH login system with email verification and ForcedCommand enforcement.

.
To set up an SSH login system that integrates email link verification and ForcedCommand with `$SHELL` access, you’ll need to work with several components. Below is a high-level guide for implementing such a system:

### Overview
1. **SSH Login**: Use SSH for authenticating users.
2. **Email Verification**: Upon login, the system will send an email containing a one-time link for verification.
3. **ForcedCommand**: Use SSH’s `ForceCommand` directive to restrict user access to a specific shell (e.g., `$SHELL`), or a command to verify the link and then execute a shell after successful verification.
4. **Send Email**: Use a mail service like `ssmtp` (or other alternatives like `msmtp` or `sendmail`) to send the verification link to the user.

### Prerequisites
- A running **SSH server**.
- A configured **mail system** (e.g., `ssmtp` or `msmtp`).
- Basic understanding of **bash scripting** and **SSH configurations**.
  
### Steps to Implement the Solution

#### 1. **Set Up SSH Server**
Ensure SSH is installed and configured on the server. Typically, SSH is configured through `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Here are the main steps:

- Open the SSH config file:  
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```

- Allow password authentication and disable root login (for security purposes).
  ```bash
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```

- Configure `ForceCommand` to specify a custom script:
  ```bash
  ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh_verification_script.sh
  ```

#### 2. **Create SSH Verification Script**
This script will be triggered every time a user attempts to log in via SSH. It will check if the user has already verified via email.

- **Create the script:**
  ```bash
  sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ssh_verification_script.sh
  ```

- **Example Script:**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  
  # Check if the user is already verified by looking for a verification flag
  if [ -f "/tmp/$USER_verified" ]; then
    exec $SHELL  # If verified, launch the shell
  else
    # Generate a unique verification token and send it via email
    verification_token=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
    echo $verification_token > /tmp/$USER_token

    # Send email with verification link
    verification_link="http://yourserver.com/verify?user=$USER&token=$verification_token"
    echo "Please verify your login by clicking this link: $verification_link" | ssmtp user@example.com

    # Display message prompting the user to verify
    echo "Verification email sent. Please check your inbox to complete login."
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

  - This script checks if a user has a file `/tmp/$USER_verified`. If the file exists, it means the user has already verified their email and is allowed to use the shell.
  - If not verified, it generates a token, writes it to a temporary file, and sends an email with the verification link using `ssmtp`.

#### 3. **Set Up a Web Server for Verification**
You need a web server to handle the verification link clicked by the user. Here's how you can implement it:

- **Install Apache/Nginx** (e.g., Apache):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install apache2
  ```

- **Create a PHP script** for verification:
  ```php
  <?php
  // Get user and token from the URL
  $user = $_GET['user'];
  $token = $_GET['token'];

  // Check if the token matches the stored token
  if (file_exists("/tmp/${user}_token") && file_get_contents("/tmp/${user}_token") == $token) {
    // Mark user as verified
    touch("/tmp/${user}_verified");

    echo "You have been successfully verified! You can now login to your account.";
  } else {
    echo "Verification failed or token expired.";
  }
  ?>
  ```

  - This PHP script checks if the token in the URL matches the one saved in `/tmp/${user}_token`.
  - If the tokens match, it creates a `/tmp/${user}_verified` file, indicating that the user is verified.

- **Make sure your server is publicly accessible** (e.g., `yourserver.com`).

#### 4. **Test the Process**
- When the user logs in via SSH, the system will check for the verification file.
- If not verified, the script sends an email with the verification link.
- The user clicks the link, which verifies them and allows access to the shell on the next login.

#### 5. **Email Setup**
Ensure you have a working email setup with `ssmtp`, `msmtp`, or another service on the server:

- **Install ssmtp**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ssmtp
  ```

- **Configure `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`** for your email provider:
  ```bash
  root=your-email@example.com
  mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
  AuthUser=your-email@example.com
  AuthPass=your-email-password
  UseTLS=YES
  ```

- Make sure you can send test emails:
  ```bash
  echo "Test email body" | ssmtp recipient@example.com
  ```

#### 6. **Security Considerations**
- Use HTTPS for the verification link to protect the token.
- Ensure temporary files like `/tmp/$USER_token` and `/tmp/$USER_verified` are cleaned up after verification.
- Set proper permissions for the script and files to prevent unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
This method integrates email verification into the SSH login process with the `ForceCommand` directive and `$SHELL` access. It adds a layer of security by ensuring that only users who have clicked the verification link can log into the system.

To set up an SSH login system that integrates email verification and uses `ForcedCommand` with `$SHELL` access, the general process can be broken into several parts:

1. **SSH Configuration with ForcedCommand:**
   - The `ForcedCommand` directive in `sshd_config` forces a specific command to be executed upon SSH login. This can be used to ensure that only certain authorized commands are executed by the user, which is useful when you want to limit shell access or execute specific scripts after authentication.

2. **Email Verification System:**
   - For email-based verification, a common method is to send a one-time link (with a token) to the user's email address when they attempt to login via SSH. This can be implemented using an external service (like `ssmtp`, `msmtp`, or an SMTP relay).

3. **Combining SSH Login and Email Verification:**
   - Upon a user attempting to SSH login, instead of just allowing the login directly, you could initiate a process where an email is sent with a verification link. The user must click on the link to confirm their identity before they are granted full shell access.

4. **Implementation Details:**

### SSH Configuration
In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, you can set up `ForcedCommand` like this:
```bash
Match User <username>
    ForcedCommand /path/to/verify_and_login.sh
    PasswordAuthentication yes  # or no, depending on your setup
```

This will force the execution of the `verify_and_login.sh` script every time this specific user attempts to SSH login.

### `verify_and_login.sh` Script
The script will check if the user has verified their email and grant or deny access based on that:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The user's email (you can also pass this as an argument)
USER_EMAIL=$(whoami)@example.com

# The path to store the verification token (you could store it in a file or database)
VERIFICATION_FILE="/tmp/verification_token_${USER_EMAIL}"

# Check if the user has a valid token for verification
if [ -f "$VERIFICATION_FILE" ]; then
  # Verification passed, allow access to the shell
  exec $SHELL
else
  # Send email with verification link using `ssmtp`
  TOKEN=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
  echo "Verification link: http://yourserver.com/verify?token=$TOKEN" | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL

  # Store token temporarily to check the validity
  echo "$TOKEN" > /tmp/token_$USER_EMAIL

  echo "Please check your email for the verification link."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Email Verification (via `ssmtp`):
You can use `ssmtp` (or any SMTP client) to send an email containing a verification link:
```bash
echo -e "Subject: SSH Login Verification\n\nClick on the following link to verify your login: http://yourserver.com/verify?token=$TOKEN" | ssmtp $USER_EMAIL
```

### Verification Web Page (example with PHP):
On the web server side, you would need a verification page to handle the token:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    
    // Validate the token and user email
    $user_email = getUserEmailByToken($token);  // This function needs to be implemented
    
    if ($user_email) {
        // Token is valid, grant access
        echo "Email verified successfully. You can now log in via SSH.";
        // Remove or mark the token as used to prevent reuse
    } else {
        echo "Invalid or expired token.";
    }
}
?>
```

### `ssmtp` Configuration:
To configure `ssmtp` to send emails, you'll need to edit the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`:
```bash
root=postmaster@example.com
mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
AuthUser=username@example.com
AuthPass=password
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=YES
```

### Final Notes:
1. **Security**: Make sure that the tokens are securely generated and stored. Ensure that links expire after a certain period to prevent abuse.
2. **Logging**: Keep track of the tokens issued and used for debugging and auditing purposes.
3. **Web Server**: Ensure your web server has proper security measures, such as SSL/TLS for the verification links.

This system is quite complex, but it can provide an extra layer of security for SSH logins.
