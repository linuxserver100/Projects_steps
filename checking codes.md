Enforcing email link click authentication during SSH access can enhance security by requiring users to verify their identity through an email link before establishing an SSH session. Below is a general approach to implement this, using a combination of a custom script, email generation, and SSH's `ForceCommand` option.

### Overview

1. **Custom Script**: This script will handle generating a unique authentication link, sending it via email, and verifying the link upon user click.
2. **Email Generation**: Use a tool like `sendmail` or an email library in Python to send the email.
3. **SSH Configuration**: Use the `ForceCommand` option to invoke the custom script before allowing a session.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Create the Custom Authentication Script

Here's a basic example of a custom script that generates a unique link, sends it via email, and waits for user verification.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Custom script for email authentication via SSH
USER=$(whoami)
EMAIL="user@example.com" # Replace with the user's email or fetch dynamically
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16) # Generate a unique token
EXPIRY=$(date -d "+5 minutes" +%s) # Set expiry time (e.g., 5 minutes from now)

# Store the token and expiry time in a temporary file
echo "$TOKEN $EXPIRY" > /tmp/ssh_auth_token_$USER.txt

# Create the authentication link
LINK="http://yourdomain.com/authenticate.php?token=$TOKEN"

# Send the email
echo "Click the link to authenticate your SSH session: $LINK" | sendmail $EMAIL

# Wait for user confirmation
while true; do
    read -p "Enter the token you received in your email: " INPUT_TOKEN
    CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)
    
    # Check if the token matches and is not expired
    if [[ "$INPUT_TOKEN" == "$TOKEN" && "$CURRENT_TIME" -le "$EXPIRY" ]]; then
        echo "Authentication successful!"
        exit 0
    else
        echo "Invalid token or expired. Please try again."
    fi
done
```

### Step 2: Create the Web Endpoint for Token Verification

You'll need a web server that can handle the verification of the token. Below is a simple PHP example (`authenticate.php`):

```php
<?php
session_start();
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    // Check the token in the temporary file
    $file = "/tmp/ssh_auth_token_" . $_SESSION['USER'] . ".txt"; // Ensure to secure user identity

    if (file_exists($file)) {
        list($stored_token, $expiry) = explode(' ', file_get_contents($file));
        
        // Verify token and expiry
        if ($token == $stored_token && time() <= $expiry) {
            echo "Authentication successful! You can now close this window.";
            // Optionally, remove the token file here
            unlink($file);
            exit;
        }
    }
}
echo "Invalid token or session expired.";
?>
```

### Step 3: Configure SSH Server

Edit your SSH server configuration file (typically located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to enforce the custom script using `ForceCommand`.

```plaintext
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /path/to/your/authentication_script.sh
```

Replace `your_username` with the actual username or use `Match Address` to restrict based on IPs.

### Step 4: Set Shell Directive

To maintain a functional shell after successful authentication, you can append `exec $SHELL` to the end of your script after successful authentication:

```bash
if [[ "$INPUT_TOKEN" == "$TOKEN" && "$CURRENT_TIME" -le "$EXPIRY" ]]; then
    echo "Authentication successful!"
    exec $SHELL # Start a new shell session
else
    echo "Invalid token or expired. Please try again."
fi
```

### Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: Ensure that the token is adequately secured and cleaned up after use.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure that the link sent in the email uses HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Temporary Files**: Secure the temporary files with appropriate permissions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for token requests to mitigate brute force attacks.

### Conclusion

This setup ensures that users must verify their identity via email before being allowed SSH access. Make sure to test the script thoroughly and adapt it to your environment as needed.
