Implementing email link click authentication for SSH using a combination of `ForceCommand`, a custom script, and email generation involves several steps. This approach requires SSH to execute a specific command when a user connects, and that command includes authentication via a link sent to their email. Here’s a detailed guide to achieving this:

### Step 1: Setup Email Sending with `ssmtp`

1. **Install `ssmtp`:**
   Ensure that `ssmtp` is installed on your server. You can install it using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ssmtp
   ```

2. **Configure `ssmtp`:**
   Configure the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` file for your SMTP server. For example:

   ```plaintext
   root=postmaster
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   ```

3. **Set Up Email Sending Script:**
   Create a script that sends an email with a unique link. Here’s an example script (`send_auth_email.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   EMAIL="$1"
   AUTH_CODE="$(openssl rand -hex 12)"
   LINK="http://yourdomain.com/authenticate?code=$AUTH_CODE"

   echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate your SSH session: $LINK" | ssmtp "$EMAIL"

   # Store AUTH_CODE and associate it with the user
   echo "$AUTH_CODE" > "/tmp/auth_code_$USER"
   ```

   Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x send_auth_email.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Create the Authentication Script

This script will handle the authentication when the user clicks the link.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# auth_link.sh
AUTH_CODE="$1"

# Check if the code matches the stored one
if [ -f "/tmp/auth_code_$USER" ]; then
    STORED_CODE="$(cat /tmp/auth_code_$USER)"
    if [ "$AUTH_CODE" == "$STORED_CODE" ]; then
        echo "Authentication successful."
        rm "/tmp/auth_code_$USER"  # Cleanup
        exec $SHELL  # Open a shell session
    else
        echo "Authentication failed."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "No authentication code found."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
chmod +x auth_link.sh
```

### Step 3: Update SSH Configuration

1. **Edit SSHD Configuration:**
   Open your SSH daemon configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and add or modify the following line:

   ```plaintext
   ForceCommand /path/to/send_auth_email.sh $USER; exec /path/to/auth_link.sh
   ```

   Ensure to replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to your scripts.

2. **Set Up the Shell Environment:**
   In the same configuration file, set the default shell to your desired shell if needed:

   ```plaintext
   Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
   ```

### Step 4: Create the Link Handling Mechanism

You'll need a web server to handle the GET request from the link that the user clicks. Here’s a simple example using PHP:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['code'])) {
    $code = $_GET['code'];
    // Call the authentication script with the code
    $output = shell_exec("/path/to/auth_link.sh $code 2>&1");
    echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
} else {
    echo "No code provided.";
}
?>
```

### Step 5: Restart SSH Service

After configuring everything, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Final Considerations

- **Security:** Ensure your scripts are secured and only accessible to authorized users.
- **Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up expired or used authentication codes.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire workflow to ensure users can authenticate smoothly.
- **Logging:** Consider adding logging for both successful and failed authentication attempts.

This setup combines SSH with email authentication, adding a layer of security for remote access.

To implement email-based link-click authentication for SSH access using `ForceCommand`, you can combine several tools and steps, including generating an authentication email, creating a custom script to verify authentication, and utilizing `ForceCommand` to control the SSH session. Here’s an outline of how you can set this up on a Linux server:

### Prerequisites

1. **ssmtp (or another email-sending tool)**: To send emails.
2. **A web server**: To host the authentication link.
3. **A custom shell script**: To verify the authentication link.
4. **SSH ForceCommand**: To control SSH command execution.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Set Up `ssmtp` (or Similar) to Send Emails

Install `ssmtp` and configure it to work with an email provider (e.g., Gmail, Postfix, etc.). If `ssmtp` is not suitable for your needs, you could also use `sendmail` or `mail`.

Example configuration for `ssmtp`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```

Configure `ssmtp` by editing `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`:
```conf
root=username@gmail.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
AuthUser=username@gmail.com
AuthPass=your_password
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

#### 2. Create the Custom Authentication Script

This script will generate a unique token for each SSH session and send it as part of a clickable link in an email.

- Create a directory for temporary tokens, like `/tmp/auth_tokens/`.
- Create a custom script, `auth_check.sh`, to generate the link and send an email with the token.

Here's an example of `auth_check.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
EMAIL="user@example.com"  # Email to send the link
TOKEN_FILE="/tmp/auth_tokens"
TOKEN=$(uuidgen)  # Generate a unique token
URL="http://yourserver.com/verify?token=$TOKEN"  # Verification URL

# Store the token in a file with the user's name
echo "$TOKEN" > "$TOKEN_FILE/${USER}.token"

# Send an email with the token link using ssmtp
echo -e "Subject: SSH Authentication\n\nClick the link to authenticate:\n$URL" | ssmtp "$EMAIL"

echo "An authentication link has been sent to your email. Please click the link to complete the SSH login."
echo "Waiting for authentication..."

# Wait for the file to be updated or deleted as a sign of authentication
while [ -f "$TOKEN_FILE/${USER}.token" ]; do
  sleep 1
done

# If the file is deleted, authentication succeeded
echo "Authentication successful. Welcome!"
exec $SHELL  # Proceed to the user's shell
```

#### 3. Configure the Web Server to Verify the Token

Set up a simple server-side script (like in PHP or Python) to delete the token file when the user clicks the link. For example, a PHP script `verify.php` could look like this:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    $user_token_file = "/tmp/auth_tokens/{$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']}.token";

    if (file_exists($user_token_file) && file_get_contents($user_token_file) === $token) {
        // Token matches, delete the file
        unlink($user_token_file);
        echo "Authentication successful!";
    } else {
        echo "Invalid or expired token.";
    }
} else {
    echo "No token provided.";
}
?>
```

Place `verify.php` on your web server and ensure it’s accessible at the URL defined in `auth_check.sh`.

#### 4. Set Up `ForceCommand` in SSH Configuration

Configure SSH to use `ForceCommand` to run the authentication script `auth_check.sh` whenever a user logs in.

1. Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
2. Add a `ForceCommand` entry for the users who need email link-click authentication. For example:

```conf
Match User your_ssh_user
    ForceCommand /path/to/auth_check.sh
```

3. Reload SSH to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

### How It Works

1. When the specified user logs in over SSH, `ForceCommand` runs `auth_check.sh`.
2. `auth_check.sh` generates a token, saves it, and sends an email with a verification link.
3. The user clicks the link in their email, triggering the server-side script (`verify.php`), which deletes the token file if the token is valid.
4. `auth_check.sh` detects the file deletion and grants access by launching the user’s default shell.

### Important Security Considerations

- **SSL**: Ensure your web server uses HTTPS to protect token transmission.
- **Permissions**: Restrict permissions for `/tmp/auth_tokens` and the scripts to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Token Expiration**: Consider implementing a timeout mechanism in `auth_check.sh` to delete stale tokens.

With this setup, users must verify each SSH session via email link click, adding an extra layer of security.
