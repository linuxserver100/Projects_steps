To enforce an OTP check using SSH with `ForceCommand`, you can set up a script that generates a one-time password (OTP) and sends it via email using `ssmtp`. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with SSH, shell scripting, and basic server configuration. 

Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites
1. **Ensure that you have root access** to configure SSH and install necessary packages.
2. **Install `ssmtp`** to send emails. On Debian/Ubuntu, use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ssmtp
   ```
   Configure `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` with your SMTP settings (e.g., Gmail or your mail server).

```bash
   root=your_email@example.com
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   FromLineOverride=YES

   ```


### Steps to Implement SSH OTP Check

#### Step 1: Set Up an OTP Generation Script
Create a script that will generate an OTP, email it to the user, and check for user input.

1. **Create the OTP Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

2. **Add the Following Script Content**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Configuration: Set the user's email and OTP validity period in seconds
   EMAIL="user@example.com"
   OTP_VALIDITY=300  # OTP is valid for 5 minutes

   # Generate a random 6-digit OTP
   OTP=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

   # Send the OTP to the user's email using ssmtp
   echo -e "Subject: SSH OTP Authentication\n\nYour OTP is: $OTP" | ssmtp $EMAIL

   # Request OTP input from the user
   echo "Enter the OTP sent to your email:"
   read -t $OTP_VALIDITY -p "OTP: " USER_INPUT

   # Verify if the input matches the generated OTP
   if [[ "$USER_INPUT" == "$OTP" ]]; then
       echo "OTP verified successfully."
       exec $SHELL
   else
       echo "Invalid OTP or OTP expired."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

#### Step 2: Configure SSH to Use `ForceCommand`
Now, configure SSH to use this script as a `ForceCommand` to enforce OTP verification on login.

1. **Edit the SSH Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. **Add/Modify the Following Lines**:
   ```bash
   Match User your_ssh_user  # Replace with the specific user or set conditions for OTP enforcement
       ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

   *Note*: This `Match User` section will enforce the OTP script only for the specified user(s). Adjust as needed.

3. **Restart the SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### Step 3: Test the Configuration
1. Attempt an SSH connection as the specified user.
2. You should receive an OTP via email.
3. Enter the OTP when prompted in the SSH session.
4. If correct, you’ll be granted access. Otherwise, the session will terminate.

### Notes
- **Security Considerations**: This is a basic OTP implementation and is suitable for testing and internal use but may not be as secure as established OTP solutions (like Google Authenticator).
- **ssmtp Alternatives**: `ssmtp` is deprecated in some distributions, so you may consider `msmtp` or configuring `mailx` as an alternative for production environments.

This configuration should provide you with a basic OTP-enforced SSH login setup.

To set up an email link click authentication system for SSH access using `ForceCommand`, you'll need to perform several steps. The configuration involves creating a script that generates a unique email link, sends it via `ssmtp`, and verifies the click before allowing access to the shell. Here's how you can do it:

### Prerequisites

1. **SSH Server**: You need an SSH server running on your machine.
2. **ssmtp**: Install `ssmtp` to send emails.
3. **Web Server**: A simple web server to handle the verification of the link.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Make sure you have `ssmtp` and `curl` installed. You can do this on a Debian/Ubuntu system with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp curl
```

### Step 2: Configure ssmtp

Edit the `ssmtp` configuration file, usually located at `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`, with your email settings:

```bash
root=your_email@example.com
mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
AuthUser=your_email@example.com
AuthPass=your_password
UseSTARTTLS=YES
FromLineOverride=YES
```

Replace `your_email@example.com`, `smtp.example.com`, and `your_password` with your actual email credentials.

### Step 3: Create a Script to Handle Email Link Authentication

Create a script that will be triggered by the SSH `ForceCommand`. This script will:

1. Generate a unique link.
2. Send the link via email.
3. Handle the link click for verification.

Here’s an example script (`/usr/local/bin/ssh-email-auth.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
USER=$1
EMAIL="user@example.com" # Change this to the user's email
BASE_URL="http://your_webserver.com/verify.php" # Change to your web server URL

# Generate a unique token
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
echo "$USER:$TOKEN" >> /tmp/ssh_auth_tokens.txt # Store the token

# Send email
echo "Click the link to authenticate your SSH session: ${BASE_URL}?token=${TOKEN}" | ssmtp $EMAIL

# Pause and wait for user to click the link
echo "Authentication email sent. Please check your inbox and click the link."

# Wait for the user to confirm
while true; do
    if grep -q "$USER:$TOKEN" /tmp/verified_tokens.txt; then
        echo "Authentication successful. Access granted."
        exec $SHELL
        break
    fi
    sleep 5
done
```

Make sure to make this script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-email-auth.sh
```

### Step 4: Create the Verification Script

Create a verification script on your web server (`verify.php`):

```php
<?php
// verify.php
if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
    $token = $_GET['token'];
    $user = ''; // You need to retrieve the user associated with this token

    // Validate the token (you can use a database or file for this)
    $filepath = '/tmp/ssh_auth_tokens.txt';
    if (file_exists($filepath)) {
        $lines = file($filepath);
        foreach ($lines as $line) {
            list($line_user, $line_token) = explode(':', trim($line));
            if ($line_token == $token) {
                // Write to verified tokens file
                file_put_contents('/tmp/verified_tokens.txt', "$line_user:$line_token\n", FILE_APPEND);
                echo "Token verified. You can now return to your SSH session.";
                exit;
            }
        }
    }
}
echo "Invalid token.";
?>
```

### Step 5: Configure SSH

In your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, set the `ForceCommand` for the user or group that should use this authentication:

```plaintext
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh-email-auth.sh your_username
```

### Step 6: Restart SSH

After making changes to the SSH configuration, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Step 7: Test the Setup

1. Try to SSH into your server as the specified user.
2. Check the email for the authentication link and click it.
3. If everything is set up correctly, you should gain access to the shell.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that the verification process is secure to avoid unauthorized access.
- Consider using HTTPS for the web server to encrypt the token.
- Use a more robust method of managing tokens (like a database) for production use.
- Regularly clean up the `/tmp/ssh_auth_tokens.txt` and `/tmp/verified_tokens.txt` files to avoid resource exhaustion.

This is a basic implementation and can be expanded or improved based on specific needs and security requirements.

Setting up SSH login with SMS authentication on an Ubuntu server involves several steps, including configuring Twilio for SMS, updating the SSH configuration, and creating a script to handle the SMS authentication. Below is a guide to help you accomplish this without using a Python pipeline.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Make sure your server has `curl` and `twilio` CLI installed. You can install them with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

### Step 2: Set Up Twilio Account

1. **Sign Up for Twilio**: Create an account on the [Twilio website](https://www.twilio.com/).

2. **Get Twilio Credentials**: After signing up, note your `Account SID`, `Auth Token`, and a phone number that you will use to send SMS messages.

### Step 3: Create the SMS Authentication Script

Create a shell script that will handle the SMS authentication. For example, you can create a script called `sms_auth.sh`:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/sms_auth.sh
```

Add the following code to the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="your_twilio_phone_number"
TO_PHONE_NUMBER="$1" # The user's phone number
SMS_CODE=$(shuf -i 1000-9999 -n 1) # Generate a random 4-digit code

# Send the SMS via Twilio
curl -X POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json \
--data-urlencode "To=$TO_PHONE_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "From=$TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "Body=Your authentication code is: $SMS_CODE" \
-u $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

# Prompt for the code entered by the user
read -p "Enter the code sent to your phone: " USER_CODE

if [ "$USER_CODE" == "$SMS_CODE" ]; then
    echo "Authentication successful!"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Authentication failed!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Make the script executable by running:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sms_auth.sh
```

### Step 5: Configure SSHD to Use the Script

Edit the SSH configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following line at the end of the file:

```plaintext
ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/sms_auth.sh %u
```

This configuration ensures that every SSH login attempts to invoke the SMS authentication script before proceeding.

### Step 6: Restart the SSH Service

After editing the SSH configuration file, restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 7: Test the Configuration

Attempt to SSH into your server from a different terminal:

```bash
ssh your_username@your_server_ip
```

You should receive an SMS with a code on the phone number specified, and you'll be prompted to enter the code.

### Security Considerations

1. **Do Not Expose the Script**: Make sure your script is secured and not accessible by unauthorized users.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: This setup provides an extra layer of security but consider combining it with other forms of authentication (like SSH keys) for even better security.
3. **Twilio Costs**: Sending SMS via Twilio incurs costs; monitor your usage.

By following these steps, you will have a working SMS authentication system for SSH logins on your Ubuntu server.
