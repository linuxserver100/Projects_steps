To set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server with email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, we can follow these general steps. Here, we'll use Google Authenticator (or `libpam-google-authenticator`) to generate OTP codes and use a Python script to send them via email. These instructions assume you already have SSH access to your server.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on your server (for sending the email).
- A working SMTP server for sending emails (like Gmail SMTP).
- `libpam-google-authenticator` package installed for OTP generation.

### Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y libpam-google-authenticator python3-pip
   pip3 install yagmail pyotp
   ```

2. **Generate OTP Secret with Google Authenticator**

   Run the following command for the user account you To set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server with email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, we can follow these general steps. Here, we'll use Google Authenticator (or `libpam-google-authenticator`) to generate OTP codes and use a Python script to send them via email. These instructions assume you already have SSH access to your server.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on your server (for sending the email).
- A working SMTP server for sending emails (like Gmail SMTP).
- `libpam-google-authenticator` package installed for OTP generation.

### Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y libpam-google-authenticator python3-pip
   pip3 install yagmail pyotp
   ```

2. **Generate OTP Secret with Google Authenticator**

   Run the following command for the user account you want to configure OTP for (e.g., your own user account).
   ```bash
   google-authenticator
   ```
   - Answer the prompts according to your preference.
   - Record the secret key or QR code generated. This will be used to generate OTPs.
   - When asked if you'd like to "disallow multiple uses of the same authentication token," answer "yes."

   This will generate a `~/.google_authenticator` file that holds the OTP secret and configuration.

3. **Create a Python Script to Send OTPs via Email**

   Create a new script called `send_otp.py` in your user's home directory or another convenient location.
   ```bash
   nano ~/send_otp.py
   ```

   Add the following code to the script:
   ```python
   import yagmail
   import pyotp
   import sys

   # Email configuration
   EMAIL = "your_email@gmail.com"      # Sender email
   APP_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"  # App password (use Google app password if using Gmail)
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL = "recipient_email@gmail.com"  # Recipient email for OTP

   # Initialize OTP generator
   otp_secret = "YOUR_OTP_SECRET"  # Replace this with the secret from Google Authenticator
   totp = pyotp.TOTP(otp_secret)

   # Generate OTP
   otp = totp.now()

   # Send OTP via email
   yag = yagmail.SMTP(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD)
   subject = "Your SSH One-Time Password"
   contents = f"Your OTP is: {otp}"
   yag.send(RECIPIENT_EMAIL, subject, contents)

   print("OTP sent successfully.")
   ```

   - Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with the sender email address.
   - Replace `your_app_password` with an app-specific password (if using Gmail or other secure email).
   - Replace `recipient_email@gmail.com` with the email that should receive the OTP.
   - Replace `YOUR_OTP_SECRET` with the secret from Google Authenticator (from Step 2).

   Save and exit the file.

4. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/send_otp.py
   ```

5. **Configure SSH to Use the OTP for Authentication**

   Update the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the user with a command to verify OTP before allowing SSH access.

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

   For each SSH key in this file, prepend it with a command to run `send_otp.py` and prompt for OTP verification. For example:
   ```bash
   command="~/send_otp.py && read -p 'Enter OTP: ' input_otp && python3 -c 'import pyotp; print(pyotp.TOTP(\"YOUR_OTP_SECRET\").verify(input_otp))' | grep -q '^True$'" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...
   ```

   - Replace `"YOUR_OTP_SECRET"` in the command with your actual OTP secret.
   - The `command` directive:
     - Sends the OTP email.
     - Prompts the user to enter the OTP during SSH login.
     - Verifies the OTP using `pyotp` (requires it to match the current OTP).

6. **Test the SSH Login**

   From a client machine, try to SSH into the server:
   ```bash
   ssh username@your-server-ip
   ```

   You should:
   - Receive an OTP via email.
   - Be prompted to enter the OTP.
   - Gain access only if the OTP is correct.

This setup provides email-based OTP without modifying PAM or `.bashrc` files, though it relies on Google Authenticator and a custom Python script. Adjustments can be made to enhance security or customize email content further.

# Ensure you have the SMS sending utility configured (like Twilio CLI or similar)
# Variables
phone_number="$1"  # Pass the phone number as an argument

# Generate a temporary SSH key
temp_key_path="/tmp/temp_ssh_key"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f "$temp_key_path" -N ""

# Prepare the private key for sending
private_key=$(cat "$temp_key_path")

# Use an SMS API (e.g., Twilio) to send the SMS
# This is a placeholder; you'll need to install an SMS CLI or use curl to hit an API
# Example using Twilio's API (replace with your API credentials and phone numbers)
curl -X POST "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json" \

-u YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

# Optional: Clean up old keys after some time, or set expiration
# This can be done using cron or a cleanup script
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x generate_temp_key.sh
```

#### 5. Create a Web Interface for SMS Requests

Example (using PHP):
```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $phone_number = $_POST["phone_number"];
    // Execute the script to generate a temporary SSH key
    exec("/path/to/generate_temp_key.sh $phone_number");
    echo "A temporary SSH key has been sent to your phone via SMS.";
}
?>
<form method="post">
    Phone Number: <input type="text" name="phone_number" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Request Login Key">
</form>
```

#### 6. Configuring SSH to Accept Temporary Keys
You can modify the SSH configuration to accept temporary keys stored in a specific location.

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the temporary key:
   ```bash
   AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/temp_ssh_key
   ```

2. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### 7. Login Using the Temporary Key
Once the user receives the temporary key via SMS, they can log in using:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/temp_ssh_key user@your_server_ip
```

### 8. Security Considerations
- **Key Expiration**: Ensure that temporary keys are deleted after use or after a set time (e.g., using a cron job to clean up `/tmp`).
- **SMS Security**: Consider the security implications of sending sensitive information via SMS. Ensure your SMS gateway is secure and reliable.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can request keys and that the system is monitored for misuse.

### Conclusion
This method allows SSH login using SMS-based authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`. It leverages the `authorized_keys` mechanism and integrates an SMS sending feature for enhanced security. Implementing this requires careful consideration of security practices, especially regarding key management and SMS transmission

2. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### 7. Login Using the Temporary Key
Once the user receives the temporary key via SMS, they can log in using:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/temp_ssh_key user@your_server_ip
```

### 8. Security Considerations
- **Key Expiration**: Ensure that temporary keys are deleted after use or after a set time (e.g., using a cron job to clean up `/tmp`).
- **SMS Security**: Consider the security implications of sending sensitive information via SMS. Ensure your SMS gateway is secure and reliable.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can request keys and that the system is monitored for misuse.

### Conclusion
This method allows SSH login using SMS-based authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`. It leverages the `authorized_keys` mechanism and integrates an SMS sending feature for enhanced security. Implementing this requires careful consideration of security practices, especially regarding key management and SMS transmission

To set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server using an email link click authentication method without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, while still utilizing the `authorized_keys` feature, you can follow a process that involves creating a temporary key for each login attempt. This will require some additional setup, including a web server and a method for sending and verifying email links.

Here’s a general outline of how to achieve this:

### Requirements
1. **Ubuntu Server**: The server should have SSH enabled.
2. **Web Server**: You can use Apache, Nginx, or any other web server.
3. **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: To send emails from the server (e.g., Postfix, Sendmail).
4. **OpenSSH Server**: Ensure OpenSSH is installed (`sudo apt install openssh-server`).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Generate a User's SSH Key Pair
On the client machine, generate an SSH key pair if the user doesn’t have one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user
```

#### 2. Set Up Authorized Keys
Add the user's public key (`id_rsa_user.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Ubuntu server for the user account they will log into. This allows the user to log in if they have the correct private key.

#### 3. Create a Temporary Key Generation Script
Create a script on the server that generates a temporary SSH key pair each time a login request is made.

Example: `generate_temp_key.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate a temporary key
temp_key_path="/tmp/temp_ssh_key"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f "$temp_key_path" -N ""

# Send an email with the private key to the user
recipient="user@example.com"  # Replace with the user's email
subject="Your Temporary SSH Key"
body="Use the following private key to login:\n\n$(cat $temp_key_path)\n\nIt will expire in 10 minutes."

echo -e "$body" | mail -s "$subject" "$recipient"

# Optionally, set a cron job or a background service to delete old keys
```

Make sure to set executable permissions for the script:

```bash
chmod +x generate_temp_key.sh
```

#### 4. Create a Web Interface for Login Requests
Set up a simple web form where users can enter their email to request a login link. This form should call the `generate_temp_key.sh` script.

Example (using PHP):
```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $email = $_POST["email"];
    // Execute the script to generate a temporary SSH key
    exec("/path/to/generate_temp_key.sh $email");
    echo "A temporary SSH key has been sent to your email.";
}
?>
<form method="post">
    Email: <input type="email" name="email" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Request Login Key">
</form>
```

#### 5. Email Verification
In the email sent to the user, include the temporary SSH key as plaintext. The user can copy this key, save it locally, and use it to log in.

#### 6. Configuring SSH to Accept Temporary Keys
You can modify the SSH configuration to accept the temporary keys from a specific directory:

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
    ```bash
    AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/temp_ssh_key
    ```

2. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    ```

#### 7. Login Using the Temporary Key
Once the user has the temporary key, they can log in using:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/temp_ssh_key user@your_server_ip
```

#### 8. Security Considerations
- **Key Expiration**: Ensure the temporary keys are automatically deleted after a certain period (you can use a cron job).
- **Email Security**: Ensure that the email transport is secure (use TLS).
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the script and temporary keys to prevent unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
This method allows for SSH login using email authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, leveraging the `authorized_keys` mechanism. It involves generating temporary SSH keys and sending them via email, providing a flexible way for users to authenticate securely.

want to configure OTP for (e.g., your own user account).
   ```bash
   google-authenticator
   ```
   - Answer the prompts according to your preference.
   - Record the secret key or QR code generated. This will be used to generate OTPs.
   - When asked if you'd like to "disallow multiple uses of the same authentication token," answer "yes."

   This will generate a `~/.google_authenticator` file that holds the OTP secret and configuration.

3. **Create a Python Script to Send OTPs via Email**

   Create a new script called `send_otp.py` in your user's home directory or another convenient location.
   ```bash
   nano ~/send_otp.py
   ```

   Add the following code to the script:
   ```python
   import yagmail
   import pyotp
   import sys

   # Email configuration
   EMAIL = "your_email@gmail.com"      # Sender email
   APP_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"  # App password (use Google app password if using Gmail)
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL = "recipient_email@gmail.com"  # Recipient email for OTP

   # Initialize OTP generator
   otp_secret = "YOUR_OTP_SECRET"  # Replace this with the secret from Google Authenticator
   totp = pyotp.TOTP(otp_secret)

   # Generate OTP
   otp = totp.now()

   # Send OTP via email
   yag = yagmail.SMTP(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD)
   subject = "Your SSH One-Time Password"
   contents = f"Your OTP is: {otp}"
   yag.send(RECIPIENT_EMAIL, subject, contents)

   print("OTP sent successfully.")
   ```

   - Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with the sender email address.
   - Replace `your_app_password` with an app-specific password (if using Gmail or other secure email).
   - Replace `recipient_email@gmail.com` with the email that should receive the OTP.
   - Replace `YOUR_OTP_SECRET` with the secret from Google Authenticator (from Step 2).

   Save and exit the file.

4. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/send_otp.py
   ```

5. **Configure SSH to Use the OTP for Authentication**

   Update the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the user with a command to verify OTP before allowing SSH access.

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

   For each SSH key in this file, prepend it with a command to run `send_otp.py` and prompt for OTP verification. For example:
   ```bash
   command="~/send_otp.py && read -p 'Enter OTP: ' input_otp && python3 -c 'import pyotp; print(pyotp.TOTP(\"YOUR_OTP_SECRET\").verify(input_otp))' | grep -q '^True$'" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...
   ```

   - Replace `"YOUR_OTP_SECRET"` in the command with your actual OTP secret.
   - The `command` directive:
     - Sends the OTP email.
     - Prompts the user to enter the OTP during SSH login.
     - Verifies the OTP using `pyotp` (requires it to match the current OTP).

6. **Test the SSH Login**

   From a client machine, try to SSH into the server:
   ```bash
   ssh username@your-server-ip
   ```

   You should:
   - Receive an OTP via email.
   - Be prompted to enter the OTP.
   - Gain access only if the OTP is correct.

This setup provides email-based OTP without modifying PAM or `.bashrc` files, though it relies on Google Authenticator and a custom Python script. Adjustments can be made to enhance security or customize email content further.

Setting up SSH login on an Ubuntu server with SMS-based authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, while still utilizing `authorized_keys`, can be achieved by leveraging a combination of SSH keys and a temporary access mechanism using SMS. Here’s how you can do this:

### Overview
The goal is to send a one-time-use SSH private key via SMS to a user upon request, allowing them to log in without needing to modify PAM or use traditional two-factor authentication methods.

### Requirements
1. **Ubuntu Server**: Ensure SSH is enabled.
2. **Web Server**: For handling SMS requests (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
3. **SMS Gateway**: A service that allows sending SMS (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo).
4. **OpenSSH Server**: Ensure OpenSSH is installed (`sudo apt install openssh-server`).
5. **Scripting Language**: Use a scripting language like Bash or Python for backend handling.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Generate User’s SSH Key Pair
On the client machine, generate an SSH key pair if the user doesn’t have one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user
```

#### 2. Set Up Authorized Keys
Add the user's public key (`id_rsa_user.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server for the user account they will log into.

#### 3. Choose an SMS Gateway
Sign up for an SMS gateway service (like Twilio or Nexmo) to send SMS messages. Obtain API credentials (API key, secret, etc.) and set up your environment to use this service.

#### 4. Create a Temporary Key Generation Script
Create a script that generates a temporary SSH key pair and sends the private key via SMS.

Example: `generate_temp_key.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure you have the SMS sending utility configured (like Twilio CLI or similar)
# Variables
phone_numberTo set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server with email OTP (One-Time Password) authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, we can follow these general steps. Here, we'll use Google Authenticator (or `libpam-google-authenticator`) to generate OTP codes and use a Python script to send them via email. These instructions assume you already have SSH access to your server.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on your server (for sending the email).
- A working SMTP server for sending emails (like Gmail SMTP).

# Ensure you have the SMS sending utility configured (like Twilio CLI or similar)
# Variables
phone_number="$1"  # Pass the phone number as an argument

# Generate a temporary SSH key
temp_key_path="/tmp/temp_ssh_key"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f "$temp_key_path" -N ""

# Prepare the private key for sending
private_key=$(cat "$temp_key_path")

# Use an SMS API (e.g., Twilio) to send the SMS
# This is a placeholder; you'll need to install an SMS CLI or use curl to hit an API
# Example using Twilio's API (replace with your API credentials and phone numbers)
curl -X POST "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json" \
--data-urlencode "To=$phone_number" \
--data-urlencode "From=YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" \

    echo "A temporary SSH key has been sent to your phone via SMS.";
}
?>
<form method="post">
    Phone Number: <input type="text" name="phone_number" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Request Login Key">
</form>
```

#### 6. Configuring SSH to Accept Temporary Keys
You can modify the SSH configuration to accept temporary keys stored in a specific location.

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the temporary key:
   ```bash
   AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/temp_ssh_key
   ```

2. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### 7. Login Using the Temporary Key
Once the user receives the temporary key via SMS, they can log in using:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/temp_ssh_key user@your_server_ip
```

### 8. Security Considerations
- **Key Expiration**: Ensure that temporary keys are deleted after use or after a set time (e.g., using a cron job to clean up `/tmp`).
- **SMS Security**: Consider the security implications of sending sensitive information via SMS. Ensure your SMS gateway is secure and reliable.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can request keys and that the system is monitored for misuse.

   APP_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"  # App password (use Google app password if using Gmail)
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL = "recipient_email@gmail.com"  # Recipient email for OTP

   # Initialize OTP generator
   otp_secret = "YOUR_OTP_SECRET"  # Replace this with the secret from Google Authenticator
   totp = pyotp.TOTP(otp_secret)

   # Generate OTP
   otp = totp.now()

   # Send OTP via email
   yag = yagmail.SMTP(EMAIL, APP_PASSWORD)
   subject = "Your SSH One-Time Password"
   contents = f"Your OTP is: {otp}"
   yag.send(RECIPIENT_EMAIL, subject, contents)

   print("OTP sent successfully.")
   ```

   - Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with the sender email address.
   - Replace `your_app_password` with an app-specific password (if using Gmail or other secure email).
   - Replace `recipient_email@gmail.com` with the email that should receive the OTP.
   - Replace `YOUR_OTP_SECRET` with the secret from Google Authenticator (from Step 2).

   Save and exit the file.

4. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/send_otp.py
   ```

5. **Configure SSH to Use the OTP for Authentication**

   Update the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the user with a command to verify OTP before allowing SSH access.

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

   For each SSH key in this file, prepend it with a command to run `send_otp.py` and prompt for OTP verification. For example:
   ```bash
   command="~/send_otp.py && read -p 'Enter OTP: ' input_otp && python3 -c 'import pyotp; print(pyotp.TOTP(\"YOUR_OTP_SECRET\").verify(input_otp))' | grep -q '^True$'" ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...
   ```

   - Replace `"YOUR_OTP_SECRET"` in the command with your actual OTP secret.
   - The `command` directive:
     - Sends the OTP email.
     - Prompts the user to enter the OTP during SSH login.
     - Verifies the OTP using `pyotp` (requires it to match the current OTP).

6. **Test the SSH Login**

   From a client machine, try to SSH into the server:
   ```bash
   ssh username@your-server-ip
   ```

   You should:
   - Receive an OTP via email.
   - Be prompted to enter the OTP.
   - Gain access only if the OTP is correct.

This setup provides email-based OTP without modifying PAM or `.bashrc` files, though it relies on Google Authenticator and a custom Python script. Adjustments can be made to enhance security or customize email content further.

Setting up SSH login on an Ubuntu server with SMS-based authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, while still utilizing `authorized_keys`, can be achieved by leveraging a combination of SSH keys and a temporary access mechanism using SMS. Here’s how you can do this:

### Overview
The goal is to send a one-time-use SSH private key via SMS to a user upon request, allowing them to log in without needing to modify PAM or use traditional two-factor authentication methods.

### Requirements
1. **Ubuntu Server**: Ensure SSH is enabled.
2. **Web Server**: For handling SMS requests (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
3. **SMS Gateway**: A service that allows sending SMS (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo).
4. **OpenSSH Server**: Ensure OpenSSH is installed (`sudo apt install openssh-server`).
5. **Scripting Language**: Use a scripting language like Bash or Python for backend handling.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Generate User’s SSH Key Pair
On the client machine, generate an SSH key pair if the user doesn’t have one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user
```

#### 2. Set Up Authorized Keys
Add the user's public key (`id_rsa_user.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server for the user account they will log into.

#### 3. Choose an SMS Gateway
Sign up for an SMS gateway service (like Twilio or Nexmo) to send SMS messages. Obtain API credentials (API key, secret, etc.) and set up your environment to use this service.

#### 4. Create a Temporary Key Generation Script
Create a script that generates a temporary SSH key pair and sends the private key via SMS.

Example: `generate_temp_key.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure you have the SMS sending utility configured (like Twilio CLI or similar)
# Variables
phone_number="$1"  # Pass the phone number as an argument

# Generate a temporary SSH key
temp_key_path="/tmp/temp_ssh_key"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f "$temp_key_path" -N ""

# Prepare the private key for sending
private_key=$(cat "$temp_key_path")

# Use an SMS API (e.g., Twilio) to send the SMS
# This is a placeholder; you'll need to install an SMS CLI or use curl to hit an API
# Example using Twilio's API (replace with your API credentials and phone numbers)
curl -X POST "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json" \
--data-urlencode "To=$phone_number" \
--data-urlencode "From=YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "Body=Your temporary SSH key:\n\n$private_key" \
-u YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

# Optional: Clean up old keys after some time, or set expiration
# This can be done using cron or a cleanup script
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x generate_temp_key.sh
```

#### 5. Create a Web Interface for SMS Requests
Set up a simple web form where users can enter their phone number to request a temporary SSH key.

Example (using PHP):
```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $phone_number = $_POST["phone_number"];
    // Execute the script to generate a temporary SSH key
    exec("/path/to/generate_temp_key.sh $phone_number");
    echo "A temporary SSH key has been sent to your phone via SMS.";
}
?>
<form method="post">
    Phone Number: <input type="text" name="phone_number" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Request Login Key">
</form>
```

#### 6. Configuring SSH to Accept Temporary Keys
You can modify the SSH configuration to accept temporary keys stored in a specific location.

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the temporary key:
   ```bash
   AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/temp_ssh_key
   ```

2. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### 7. Login Using the Temporary Key
Once the user receives the temporary key via SMS, they can log in using:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/temp_ssh_key user@your_server_ip
```

### 8. Security Considerations
- **Key Expiration**: Ensure that temporary keys are deleted after use or after a set time (e.g., using a cron job to clean up `/tmp`).
- **SMS Security**: Consider the security implications of sending sensitive information via SMS. Ensure your SMS gateway is secure and reliable.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can request keys and that the system is monitored for misuse.

### Conclusion
This method allows SSH login using SMS-based authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`. It leverages the `authorized_keys` mechanism and integrates an SMS sending feature for enhanced security. Implementing this requires careful consideration of security practices, especially regarding key management and SMS transmission

To set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server using an email link click authentication method without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, while still utilizing the `authorized_keys` feature, you can follow a process that involves creating a temporary key for each login attempt. This will require some additional setup, including a web server and a method for sending and verifying email links.

Here’s a general outline of how to achieve this:

### Requirements
1. **Ubuntu Server**: The server should have SSH enabled.
2. **Web Server**: You can use Apache, Nginx, or any other web server.
3. **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: To send emails from the server (e.g., Postfix, Sendmail).
4. **OpenSSH Server**: Ensure OpenSSH is installed (`sudo apt install openssh-server`).

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Generate a User's SSH Key Pair
On the client machine, generate an SSH key pair if the user doesn’t have one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_user
```

#### 2. Set Up Authorized Keys
Add the user's public key (`id_rsa_user.pub`) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Ubuntu server for the user account they will log into. This allows the user to log in if they have the correct private key.

#### 3. Create a Temporary Key Generation Script
Create a script on the server that generates a temporary SSH key pair each time a login request is made.

Example: `generate_temp_key.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate a temporary key
temp_key_path="/tmp/temp_ssh_key"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f "$temp_key_path" -N ""

# Send an email with the private key to the user
recipient="user@example.com"  # Replace with the user's email
subject="Your Temporary SSH Key"
body="Use the following private key to login:\n\n$(cat $temp_key_path)\n\nIt will expire in 10 minutes."

echo -e "$body" | mail -s "$subject" "$recipient"

# Optionally, set a cron job or a background service to delete old keys
```

Make sure to set executable permissions for the script:

```bash
chmod +x generate_temp_key.sh
```

#### 4. Create a Web Interface for Login Requests
Set up a simple web form where users can enter their email to request a login link. This form should call the `generate_temp_key.sh` script.

Example (using PHP):
```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $email = $_POST["email"];
    // Execute the script to generate a temporary SSH key
    exec("/path/to/generate_temp_key.sh $email");
    echo "A temporary SSH key has been sent to your email.";
}
?>
<form method="post">
    Email: <input type="email" name="email" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Request Login Key">
</form>
```

#### 5. Email Verification
In the email sent to the user, include the temporary SSH key as plaintext. The user can copy this key, save it locally, and use it to log in.

#### 6. Configuring SSH to Accept Temporary Keys
You can modify the SSH configuration to accept the temporary keys from a specific directory:

1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
    ```bash
    AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys /tmp/temp_ssh_key
    ```

2. Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    ```

#### 7. Login Using the Temporary Key
Once the user has the temporary key, they can log in using:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/temp_ssh_key user@your_server_ip
```

#### 8. Security Considerations
- **Key Expiration**: Ensure the temporary keys are automatically deleted after a certain period (you can use a cron job).
- **Email Security**: Ensure that the email transport is secure (use TLS).
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the script and temporary keys to prevent unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
This method allows for SSH login using email authentication without modifying PAM or `.bashrc`, leveraging the `authorized_keys` mechanism. It involves generating temporary SSH keys and sending them via email, providing a flexible way for users to authenticate securely.
