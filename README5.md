To enforce an OTP check using SSH with `ForceCommand`, you can set up a script that generates a one-time password (OTP) and sends it via email using `ssmtp`. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with SSH, shell scripting, and basic server configuration. 

Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites
1. **Ensure that you have root access** to configure SSH and install necessary packages.
2. **Install `ssmtp`** to send emails. On Debian/Ubuntu, use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ssmtp
   ```
   Configure `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` with your SMTP settings (e.g., Gmail or your mail server).

```bash
   root=your_email@example.com
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   FromLineOverride=YES

   ```


### Steps to Implement SSH OTP Check

#### Step 1: Set Up an OTP Generation Script
Create a script that will generate an OTP, email it to the user, and check for user input.

1. **Create the OTP Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

2. **Add the Following Script Content**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Configuration: Set the user's email and OTP validity period in seconds
   EMAIL="user@example.com"
   OTP_VALIDITY=300  # OTP is valid for 5 minutes

   # Generate a random 6-digit OTP
   OTP=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

   # Send the OTP to the user's email using ssmtp
   echo -e "Subject: SSH OTP Authentication\n\nYour OTP is: $OTP" | ssmtp $EMAIL

   # Request OTP input from the user
   echo "Enter the OTP sent to your email:"
   read -t $OTP_VALIDITY -p "OTP: " USER_INPUT

   # Verify if the input matches the generated OTP
   if [[ "$USER_INPUT" == "$OTP" ]]; then
       echo "OTP verified successfully."
       exec $SHELL
   else
       echo "Invalid OTP or OTP expired."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

#### Step 2: Configure SSH to Use `ForceCommand`
Now, configure SSH to use this script as a `ForceCommand` to enforce OTP verification on login.

1. **Edit the SSH Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. **Add/Modify the Following Lines**:
   ```bash
   Match User your_ssh_user  # Replace with the specific user or set conditions for OTP enforcement
       ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

   *Note*: This `Match User` section will enforce the OTP script only for the specified user(s). Adjust as needed.

3. **Restart the SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### Step 3: Test the Configuration
1. Attempt an SSH connection as the specified user.
2. You should receive an OTP via email.
3. Enter the OTP when prompted in the SSH session.
4. If correct, you’ll be granted access. Otherwise, the session will terminate.

### Notes
- **Security Considerations**: This is a basic OTP implementation and is suitable for testing and internal use but may not be as secure as established OTP solutions (like Google Authenticator).
- **ssmtp Alternatives**: `ssmtp` is deprecated in some distributions, so you may consider `msmtp` or configuring `mailx` as an alternative for production environments.

This configuration should provide you with a basic OTP-enforced SSH login setup.

To implement phone SMS authentication for SSH without Twilio, you can use an alternative service like **Nexmo** (now called **Vonage**), which offers a similar API for sending SMS. Below is a revised implementation using Nexmo (Vonage).

### Requirements
1. **Vonage (Nexmo) Account**: Sign up for Vonage and obtain your API key, API secret, and a Vonage phone number.
2. **ssmtp**: For email functionality (optional, in case you wish to send notifications via email).
3. **SSH Server**: Ensure your server is running SSH (OpenSSH).
4. **Bash or Python**: A scripting language to create the custom authentication script.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Required Packages
You will need `curl` (if not already installed) to make HTTP requests:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

#### Step 2: Create the SMS Sending Script
Create a script that sends an SMS using the Vonage API.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

Add the following content to the script (replace placeholders with your Vonage credentials):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Vonage API Credentials
API_KEY="your_vonage_api_key"
API_SECRET="your_vonage_api_secret"
FROM_NUMBER="your_vonage_number"
TO_NUMBER="$1"
MESSAGE="$2"

# Send SMS using Vonage API
curl -X POST "https://rest.nexmo.com/sms/json" \
--data-urlencode "api_key=$API_KEY" \
--data-urlencode "api_secret=$API_SECRET" \
--data-urlencode "from=$FROM_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "to=$TO_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "text=$MESSAGE"
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the Custom SSH Command
Edit the SSH configuration file to use `ForceCommand` and execute your custom authentication script.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify the following lines to include `ForceCommand`:

```plaintext
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

#### Step 4: Create the Authentication Script
Now, create the `authenticate.sh` script that will handle the SMS authentication.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

Here’s an example of what this script might look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# User's phone number
PHONE_NUMBER="user_phone_number"

# Generate a random 6-digit code
CODE=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

# Send the SMS code to the user
/usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh "$PHONE_NUMBER" "Your SSH authentication code is: $CODE"

# Prompt for the code from the user
echo -n "Enter the SMS code: "
read INPUT_CODE

# Validate the code entered by the user
if [[ "$INPUT_CODE" == "$CODE" ]]; then
    echo "Authentication successful. Starting shell..."
    exec $SHELL
else
    echo "Authentication failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

#### Step 5: Restart SSH Service
After making these changes, restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Step 6: Testing
1. Attempt to SSH into the server as the specified user.
2. You should receive an SMS with the authentication code.
3. Enter the code when prompted to gain access.

### Important Considerations
- **Security**: SMS-based authentication is inherently less secure than other methods, such as time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or hardware tokens. It's vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks, interception, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: To avoid abuse, implement rate limiting in your script to restrict the number of SMS messages sent in a short time.
- **Logging**: It’s recommended to log all access attempts and failures for audit purposes.

### Additional Enhancements
- **Database or File Storage**: You can enhance the security by storing phone numbers in a secure database or file, rather than hardcoding them in scripts.
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to account for network failures, invalid API responses, or other issues.
- **Environment Variables**: Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like the API key, secret, and phone number, store them in environment variables or a configuration file.

### Conclusion
This solution provides a basic implementation for adding SMS-based two-factor authentication to SSH using the Vonage API. While it is a simple and straightforward method, remember that SMS-based authentication can be vulnerable to various attacks. For higher security, you may want to consider using more robust authentication methods such as TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) or hardware security keys like YubiKey.
