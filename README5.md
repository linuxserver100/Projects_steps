To enforce an OTP check using SSH with `ForceCommand` and send the OTP via email, follow these steps. This configuration uses a simple OTP script triggered by SSH `ForceCommand` and `ssmtp` to send emails. Here’s how to set it up:

### Step 1: Install Necessary Packages

You need `ssmtp` or an equivalent SMTP client to send emails. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssmtp
```

### Step 2: Configure ssmtp

Edit `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to set up SMTP for your email account:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
```

Add your SMTP server’s settings, like below:

```plaintext
root=your-email@example.com
mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
AuthUser=your-email@example.com
AuthPass=your-email-password
UseSTARTTLS=YES
```

Make sure to replace these values with your actual email provider's SMTP details.

### Step 3: Create the OTP Script

Create a script that generates a random OTP, emails it, and checks if the user enters the correct OTP. 

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/otp_check.sh
```

Add the following code to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# User email address (this should be set per user or use a lookup)
USER_EMAIL="user-email@example.com"

# Generate a random 6-digit OTP
OTP=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

# Send OTP to user's email
echo "Your OTP for SSH login is: $OTP" | ssmtp "$USER_EMAIL"

# Prompt the user to enter the OTP
echo "Enter OTP sent to your email:"
read -s USER_OTP

# Check if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP
if [[ "$USER_OTP" == "$OTP" ]]; then
    # If OTP matches, start the user’s default shell
    exec $SHELL
else
    # If OTP does not match, deny access
    echo "Invalid OTP. Access denied."
    exit 1
fi
```

Save and close the file. Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/otp_check.sh
```

### Step 4: Configure SSH to Use the OTP Script with ForceCommand

Edit your SSH daemon configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify the `ForceCommand` directive to point to the OTP script:

```plaintext
ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/otp_check.sh
```

Make sure to include conditions so it doesn’t affect `scp` or `sftp` sessions if needed, by adding this above `ForceCommand`:

```plaintext
Match User *,!scp,!sftp
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/otp_check.sh
```

### Step 5: Restart SSHD

Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Notes:
- This setup assumes that `ssmtp` is configured to work with your SMTP provider. 
- Ensure permissions on sensitive files like `otp_check.sh` and `ssmtp.conf` are secure.
- Optionally, you could store user emails and settings in a centralized file or database to support multiple users. 

This configuration enforces an OTP check before granting SSH access by emailing a unique code to the user and verifying it upon login.

Setting up SSH login on an Ubuntu server using email link click authentication involves several steps. This approach typically requires some additional software, as native SSH does not support email link click authentication by default. One popular method is to use a combination of SSH with a web server to handle the email link, and `ForceCommand` in the SSH config to enforce the authentication method.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites
1. **Ubuntu Server**: Ensure you have an Ubuntu server running.
2. **Domain Name**: You should have a domain name pointing to your server's IP address.
3. **Email Setup**: You need a working email server or a third-party service to send emails.

### Step 1: Install Necessary Software
You need a web server and a scripting language. You can use Apache or Nginx and PHP, or you could use Python or Node.js.

For this example, let’s assume you're using Apache and PHP:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php
```

### Step 2: Create a Simple PHP Script for Authentication

1. Navigate to the web directory:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   ```

2. Create a file called `auth.php`:

   ```bash
   sudo nano auth.php
   ```

3. Add the following code to handle authentication:

   ```php
   <?php
   session_start();
   
   if (isset($_GET['token'])) {
       $token = $_GET['token'];

       // Validate the token (you need to implement token generation and storage logic)
       // If valid, allow SSH access
       if (validate_token($token)) {
           $_SESSION['authenticated'] = true;
           // Redirect to SSH
           header('Location: ssh://your_username@your_server_ip');
           exit();
       } else {
           echo "Invalid token.";
       }
   }

   function validate_token($token) {
       // Implement your token validation logic here
       // Check against a database or a predefined list
       return true; // Placeholder, replace with actual validation
   }
   ?>
   ```

4. Save and exit the file.

### Step 3: Generate and Send the Authentication Link

1. You need a script to generate the email with a unique link:

   ```php
   // Send email function (simplified, use PHPMailer for production)
   function send_email($email, $token) {
       $subject = "Your SSH Login Link";
       $link = "http://your_domain/auth.php?token=" . $token;
       $message = "Click this link to authenticate: " . $link;

       mail($email, $subject, $message);
   }
   ```

2. Implement a way to generate a unique token, store it securely, and call the `send_email` function with the user’s email.

### Step 4: Configure SSH to Use `ForceCommand`

1. Open the SSH configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end:

   ```plaintext
   Match User your_username
       ForceCommand /path/to/your/script.sh
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/script.sh` with the path to your script that handles the logic for checking if the user is authenticated. This could be a script that checks if the session variable is set.

3. Create the script `script.sh`:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /path/to/your/script.sh
   ```

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   if [ ! -z "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]; then
       # Check if the user is authenticated via a mechanism you implemented
       if [ "$(curl -s http://your_domain/check_auth.php)" != "authenticated" ]; then
           echo "Authentication required."
           exit 1
       fi
   fi
   ```

4. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh
   ```

### Step 5: Restart SSH Service

After making changes to the SSH configuration, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Step 6: Testing

1. To test, try SSH into your server:

   ```bash
   ssh your_username@your_server_ip
   ```

2. If the ForceCommand checks fail (i.e., the session variable is not set), it should prompt for authentication via the email link.

### Important Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: Ensure that the token generation and validation logic is secure to prevent unauthorized access.
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for your web server to secure the token transmission.
- **Session Management**: Implement session management properly to prevent session hijacking.
- **Firewall**: Ensure your server is secured with proper firewall rules.

This method requires thorough testing and security hardening before using in a production environment. Consider alternatives like MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) if security is a primary concern.

Setting up SSH login with SMS authentication on an Ubuntu server involves several steps, including configuring Twilio for SMS, updating the SSH configuration, and creating a script to handle the SMS authentication. Below is a guide to help you accomplish this without using a Python pipeline.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Make sure your server has `curl` and `twilio` CLI installed. You can install them with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

### Step 2: Set Up Twilio Account

1. **Sign Up for Twilio**: Create an account on the [Twilio website](https://www.twilio.com/).

2. **Get Twilio Credentials**: After signing up, note your `Account SID`, `Auth Token`, and a phone number that you will use to send SMS messages.

### Step 3: Create the SMS Authentication Script

Create a shell script that will handle the SMS authentication. For example, you can create a script called `sms_auth.sh`:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/sms_auth.sh
```

Add the following code to the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="your_twilio_phone_number"
TO_PHONE_NUMBER="$1" # The user's phone number
SMS_CODE=$(shuf -i 1000-9999 -n 1) # Generate a random 4-digit code

# Send the SMS via Twilio
curl -X POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json \
--data-urlencode "To=$TO_PHONE_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "From=$TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "Body=Your authentication code is: $SMS_CODE" \
-u $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

# Prompt for the code entered by the user
read -p "Enter the code sent to your phone: " USER_CODE

if [ "$USER_CODE" == "$SMS_CODE" ]; then
    echo "Authentication successful!"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Authentication failed!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Make the script executable by running:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sms_auth.sh
```

### Step 5: Configure SSHD to Use the Script

Edit the SSH configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following line at the end of the file:

```plaintext
ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/sms_auth.sh %u
```

This configuration ensures that every SSH login attempts to invoke the SMS authentication script before proceeding.

### Step 6: Restart the SSH Service

After editing the SSH configuration file, restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 7: Test the Configuration

Attempt to SSH into your server from a different terminal:

```bash
ssh your_username@your_server_ip
```

You should receive an SMS with a code on the phone number specified, and you'll be prompted to enter the code.

### Security Considerations

1. **Do Not Expose the Script**: Make sure your script is secured and not accessible by unauthorized users.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: This setup provides an extra layer of security but consider combining it with other forms of authentication (like SSH keys) for even better security.
3. **Twilio Costs**: Sending SMS via Twilio incurs costs; monitor your usage.

By following these steps, you will have a working SMS authentication system for SSH logins on your Ubuntu server.
