To enforce an OTP check using SSH with `ForceCommand`, you can set up a script that generates a one-time password (OTP) and sends it via email using `ssmtp`. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with SSH, shell scripting, and basic server configuration. 

Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites
1. **Ensure that you have root access** to configure SSH and install necessary packages.
2. **Install `ssmtp`** to send emails. On Debian/Ubuntu, use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ssmtp
   ```
   Configure `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` with your SMTP settings (e.g., Gmail or your mail server).

```bash
   root=your_email@example.com
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   FromLineOverride=YES

   ```


### Steps to Implement SSH OTP Check

#### Step 1: Set Up an OTP Generation Script
Create a script that will generate an OTP, email it to the user, and check for user input.

1. **Create the OTP Script**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

2. **Add the Following Script Content**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Configuration: Set the user's email and OTP validity period in seconds
   EMAIL="user@example.com"
   OTP_VALIDITY=300  # OTP is valid for 5 minutes

   # Generate a random 6-digit OTP
   OTP=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

   # Send the OTP to the user's email using ssmtp
   echo -e "Subject: SSH OTP Authentication\n\nYour OTP is: $OTP" | ssmtp $EMAIL

   # Request OTP input from the user
   echo "Enter the OTP sent to your email:"
   read -t $OTP_VALIDITY -p "OTP: " USER_INPUT

   # Verify if the input matches the generated OTP
   if [[ "$USER_INPUT" == "$OTP" ]]; then
       echo "OTP verified successfully."
       exec $SHELL
   else
       echo "Invalid OTP or OTP expired."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

#### Step 2: Configure SSH to Use `ForceCommand`
Now, configure SSH to use this script as a `ForceCommand` to enforce OTP verification on login.

1. **Edit the SSH Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. **Add/Modify the Following Lines**:
   ```bash
   Match User your_ssh_user  # Replace with the specific user or set conditions for OTP enforcement
       ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh-otp-check.sh
   ```

   *Note*: This `Match User` section will enforce the OTP script only for the specified user(s). Adjust as needed.

3. **Restart the SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

#### Step 3: Test the Configuration
1. Attempt an SSH connection as the specified user.
2. You should receive an OTP via email.
3. Enter the OTP when prompted in the SSH session.
4. If correct, you’ll be granted access. Otherwise, the session will terminate.

### Notes
- **Security Considerations**: This is a basic OTP implementation and is suitable for testing and internal use but may not be as secure as established OTP solutions (like Google Authenticator).
- **ssmtp Alternatives**: `ssmtp` is deprecated in some distributions, so you may consider `msmtp` or configuring `mailx` as an alternative for production environments.

This configuration should provide you with a basic OTP-enforced SSH login setup.

To implement SMS-based SSH authentication using **Twilio** and **Bash** (without relying on Python), you can use Twilio’s API to send the SMS messages. The process involves creating an account with Twilio, setting up your server to interact with Twilio, and using `curl` to send the SMS.

### Prerequisites:
1. **Twilio Account**: You need a Twilio account. Create one at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
2. **Twilio API Credentials**: After signing up, get your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
3. **Twilio Phone Number**: Purchase a phone number from Twilio that can send SMS.
4. **SSH Access**: Basic SSH access set up on your server.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Install `curl` (if not already installed)
`curl` is used to make API requests to Twilio. Most Linux distributions have `curl` installed by default, but you can install it if it's missing:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

#### Step 2: Configure Twilio for SMS
1. **Get Twilio API credentials**:
   - Sign up for a free Twilio account.
   - Get your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the Twilio console.
   - Buy a Twilio phone number that is capable of sending SMS (this is required for sending SMS).

#### Step 3: Create the SMS Sending Script Using Twilio

Create a script that will send an SMS using Twilio’s API.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

Add the following content to the script, replacing the placeholders with your actual Twilio details.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number
TWILIO_SID="your_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="your_twilio_phone_number"

# The recipient's phone number
TO_NUMBER="$1"
# The SMS message content
MESSAGE="$2"

# Send the SMS via Twilio using curl
curl -X POST https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/$TWILIO_SID/Messages.json \
--data-urlencode "To=$TO_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "From=$TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "Body=$MESSAGE" \
-u "$TWILIO_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

This script will send an SMS to the number provided (`$1` is the recipient's number) with the message provided (`$2` is the message content).

#### Step 4: Create the SSH Authentication Script
This script will handle the SMS-based authentication process. It will generate a random code, send it via SMS using the `send_sms.sh` script, and then prompt the user to enter the code.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

Add the following content to the authentication script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Replace this with the actual user's phone number
PHONE_NUMBER="user_phone_number"

# Generate a random 6-digit code
CODE=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

# Send the SMS code to the user using the send_sms.sh script
/usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh "$PHONE_NUMBER" "Your SSH authentication code is: $CODE"

# Prompt the user to enter the code they received
echo -n "Enter the SMS code: "
read INPUT_CODE

# Validate the code entered by the user
if [[ "$INPUT_CODE" == "$CODE" ]]; then
    echo "Authentication successful. Starting shell..."
    exec $SHELL
else
    echo "Authentication failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

This script does the following:
1. It generates a random 6-digit code.
2. Sends the code to the specified phone number using Twilio.
3. Prompts the user to enter the code they received.
4. If the entered code matches the generated code, the user is authenticated and granted access to the shell.

#### Step 5: Modify SSH Configuration
Next, you’ll modify the SSH server configuration to use the authentication script.

Edit the SSH configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add the following lines to force SSH to use the custom authentication script for a specific user:

```plaintext
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

Replace `your_username` with the actual username you want to enable SMS authentication for.

#### Step 6: Restart SSH Service
After making these changes, restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

#### Step 7: Testing the Setup
1. Try to SSH into the server as the specified user.
2. You will receive an SMS with a code.
3. Enter the code when prompted to authenticate and gain access.

### Important Considerations:
- **Security**: As mentioned, SMS-based authentication is not the most secure method because of vulnerabilities like SIM swapping. For higher security, consider using TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) or hardware-based authentication methods.
- **Twilio Costs**: Sending SMS via Twilio incurs costs, even if using a free account. Check Twilio’s pricing to ensure it fits your budget.
- **Error Handling**: You should add error handling to account for issues like network failures or API errors (e.g., Twilio service disruptions).
- **Phone Number Management**: It's better to store phone numbers securely, such as in a database or secure configuration file, rather than hardcoding them in the script.

### Conclusion
This solution uses Twilio to send SMS-based authentication codes for SSH login. It bypasses the need for complex dependencies like Python, relying solely on Bash and `curl` to interact with Twilio's API.

To implement phone SMS authentication for SSH without Twilio, you can use an alternative service like **Nexmo** (now called **Vonage**), which offers a similar API for sending SMS. Below is a revised implementation using Nexmo (Vonage).

### Requirements
1. **Vonage (Nexmo) Account**: Sign up for Vonage and obtain your API key, API secret, and a Vonage phone number.
2. **ssmtp**: For email functionality (optional, in case you wish to send notifications via email).
3. **SSH Server**: Ensure your server is running SSH (OpenSSH).
4. **Bash or Python**: A scripting language to create the custom authentication script.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Required Packages
You will need `curl` (if not already installed) to make HTTP requests:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

#### Step 2: Create the SMS Sending Script
Create a script that sends an SMS using the Vonage API.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

Add the following content to the script (replace placeholders with your Vonage credentials):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Vonage API Credentials
API_KEY="your_vonage_api_key"
API_SECRET="your_vonage_api_secret"
FROM_NUMBER="your_vonage_number"
TO_NUMBER="$1"
MESSAGE="$2"

# Send SMS using Vonage API
curl -X POST "https://rest.nexmo.com/sms/json" \
--data-urlencode "api_key=$API_KEY" \
--data-urlencode "api_secret=$API_SECRET" \
--data-urlencode "from=$FROM_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "to=$TO_NUMBER" \
--data-urlencode "text=$MESSAGE"
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the Custom SSH Command
Edit the SSH configuration file to use `ForceCommand` and execute your custom authentication script.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify the following lines to include `ForceCommand`:

```plaintext
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

#### Step 4: Create the Authentication Script
Now, create the `authenticate.sh` script that will handle the SMS authentication.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

Here’s an example of what this script might look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# User's phone number
PHONE_NUMBER="user_phone_number"

# Generate a random 6-digit code
CODE=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

# Send the SMS code to the user
/usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh "$PHONE_NUMBER" "Your SSH authentication code is: $CODE"

# Prompt for the code from the user
echo -n "Enter the SMS code: "
read INPUT_CODE

# Validate the code entered by the user
if [[ "$INPUT_CODE" == "$CODE" ]]; then
    echo "Authentication successful. Starting shell..."
    exec $SHELL
else
    echo "Authentication failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

#### Step 5: Restart SSH Service
After making these changes, restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Step 6: Testing
1. Attempt to SSH into the server as the specified user.
2. You should receive an SMS with the authentication code.
3. Enter the code when prompted to gain access.

### Important Considerations
- **Security**: SMS-based authentication is inherently less secure than other methods, such as time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or hardware tokens. It's vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks, interception, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: To avoid abuse, implement rate limiting in your script to restrict the number of SMS messages sent in a short time.
- **Logging**: It’s recommended to log all access attempts and failures for audit purposes.

### Additional Enhancements
- **Database or File Storage**: You can enhance the security by storing phone numbers in a secure database or file, rather than hardcoding them in scripts.
- **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to account for network failures, invalid API responses, or other issues.
- **Environment Variables**: Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like the API key, secret, and phone number, store them in environment variables or a configuration file.

### Conclusion
This solution provides a basic implementation for adding SMS-based two-factor authentication to SSH using the Vonage API. While it is a simple and straightforward method, remember that SMS-based authentication can be vulnerable to various attacks. For higher security, you may want to consider using more robust authentication methods such as TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) or hardware security keys like YubiKey.

.
To implement SSH authentication with SMS without relying on external services like Vonage or Twilio, we would need to use a local SMS gateway or service that can send SMS messages directly from your server. In this case, I'll provide a solution where the SMS is sent using a local GSM modem or mobile phone connected to the server, assuming you have the appropriate hardware.

### Prerequisites:
1. **GSM Modem or Mobile Phone**: Your server needs a GSM modem or mobile phone connected via USB or Bluetooth that supports sending SMS.
2. **SMSC Library**: A tool like `gammu` or `smstools` to interface with the GSM device and send SMS.

We'll use **Gammu** in this case, which can send SMS messages via a GSM modem or mobile phone.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Gammu
First, install Gammu and its dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gammu gammu-smsd
```

#### Step 2: Configure Gammu
You need to configure Gammu to work with your GSM modem or mobile phone. Run the following command to configure it:

```bash
gammu-config
```

This will walk you through the process of setting up the configuration for your device. After completing the setup, Gammu will be able to send SMS messages through your modem or phone.

Alternatively, you can manually create a configuration file at `~/.gammurc` (or `/etc/gammu/config` if you want it system-wide) with the following structure:

```plaintext
[gammu]
port = /dev/ttyUSB0   # Adjust with the port your device is connected to
connection = at115200  # Or another connection string if needed
```

#### Step 3: Create the SMS Sending Script
Create a script to send an SMS via Gammu.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

Add the following content to the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# User's phone number
TO_NUMBER="$1"
MESSAGE="$2"

# Send SMS using Gammu
gammu sendsms TEXT "$TO_NUMBER" -text "$MESSAGE"
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh
```

#### Step 4: Set Up the Custom SSH Command
Now, you will configure SSH to use a custom script for user authentication. Edit the SSH configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify the following lines:

```plaintext
Match User your_username
    ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

#### Step 5: Create the Authentication Script
Create a script that will handle the SMS-based authentication. This script will generate a random code, send it via SMS, and then prompt the user to enter the code.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# User's phone number
PHONE_NUMBER="user_phone_number"  # Replace with the actual user's phone number

# Generate a random 6-digit code
CODE=$(shuf -i 100000-999999 -n 1)

# Send the SMS code to the user
/usr/local/bin/send_sms.sh "$PHONE_NUMBER" "Your SSH authentication code is: $CODE"

# Prompt the user to enter the code
echo -n "Enter the SMS code: "
read INPUT_CODE

# Validate the code entered by the user
if [[ "$INPUT_CODE" == "$CODE" ]]; then
    echo "Authentication successful. Starting shell..."
    exec $SHELL
else
    echo "Authentication failed."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make this script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/authenticate.sh
```

#### Step 6: Restart SSH Service
After making these changes, restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Step 7: Testing
1. Attempt to SSH into the server as the specified user.
2. You should receive an SMS with the authentication code.
3. Enter the code when prompted to gain access.

### Important Considerations:
1. **Security**: SMS-based authentication is less secure than other methods like TOTP or hardware tokens. SMS is vulnerable to attacks such as SIM swapping and interception.
2. **Phone Number Management**: Hardcoding phone numbers directly in the script is not ideal. Ideally, store phone numbers in a secure database or configuration file.
3. **Device Management**: The GSM modem or mobile phone must be kept available and functioning at all times to ensure authentication works.
4. **SMS Limits**: Depending on your GSM provider and the modem, there might be restrictions or costs associated with sending SMS messages.
5. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling should be added to account for issues like device disconnections, network failures, or invalid phone numbers.

### Conclusion
This solution leverages a local GSM modem or mobile phone connected to your server to send SMS messages for SSH authentication, bypassing the need for external SMS services like Twilio or Vonage. However, it's important to consider the security implications of SMS-based authentication and the need to maintain the hardware and configuration for it to function properly.
