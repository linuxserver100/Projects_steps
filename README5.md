To set up SSH login on an Ubuntu server using email-based One-Time Password (OTP) and configure your shell environment correctly with a `.bashrc` file, you'll need to follow a series of steps. Here's a comprehensive guide to accomplish this.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

1. **Install `ssmtp` or `msmtp`** to send emails:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ssmtp
   ```

2. **Install `libpam-google-authenticator`** to handle OTP:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Email Sending

1. Edit the SSMTP configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
   ```
   Add or modify the following lines (replace with your email provider's SMTP settings):
   ```
   root=your_email@example.com
   mailhub=smtp.example.com:587
   AuthUser=your_email@example.com
   AuthPass=your_email_password
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   ```

2. **Test Email Sending**:
   Create a test file and send a test email to verify your SMTP settings:
   ```bash
   echo "Subject: Test Email" | ssmtp recipient@example.com
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Google Authenticator for OTP

1. **Generate a new OTP secret** for your user:
   ```bash
   google-authenticator
   ```
   - Answer the prompts to configure OTP. Make sure to save the QR code or the secret key.

2. **Configure PAM for SSH**:
   Edit the PAM configuration for SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
   ```
   Add the following line at the top:
   ```
   auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
   ```

3. **Configure SSH to Allow Challenge-Response Authentication**:
   Edit the SSH daemon configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   Ensure the following settings are set:
   ```
   ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
   ```

4. **Restart the SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

### Step 4: Configure .bashrc

1. Open your `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add any custom configurations or aliases. For example:
   ```bash
   # Custom prompt
   export PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h:\[\e[33m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\$ "
   
   # Aliases
   alias ll='ls -la'
   alias gs='git status'

   # PATH configuration
   export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. **Load the Changes**:
   To apply changes immediately:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Step 5: Test the Setup

1. **Try SSH Login**:
   Open a new terminal or SSH session to your server. You should be prompted for a password, and then youâ€™ll need to enter the OTP sent to your email.

2. **Verify .bashrc Configurations**:
   After logging in, check if your prompt and aliases work as expected.

### Troubleshooting

- **Email Sending Issues**: Check your SMTP settings and ensure that your email provider allows SMTP connections.
- **OTP Issues**: Ensure the time on your server is synchronized with a time server, as OTP is time-sensitive.
- **Check Logs**: If you're having issues, check `/var/log/auth.log` for PAM and SSH-related logs.

### Security Note

Using email for OTP is less secure than using an authenticator app because email can be intercepted. For better security, consider using an authenticator app or hardware token.
