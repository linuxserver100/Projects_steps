Sure! Here's the complete rewritten process, following the same structure with all the steps included, and making sure the process for handling the JSON credentials files is clear:

---

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., `youtube-to-google-drive`).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or use GitHub's web editor to add files.

#### Step 2: Set up Google APIs
1. **Create a Project in Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (e.g., `youtube-to-drive`).

2. **Enable YouTube Data API & Google Drive API**:
   - In the **APIs & Services** section, search for and enable both the **YouTube Data API v3** and **Google Drive API**.

3. **Create Credentials**:
   - For the **YouTube API**, create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (to access YouTube).
   - For **Google Drive API**, create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (to upload files to Drive).
   - Instead of downloading the JSON files, you will copy the content of these files and store them as GitHub secrets.

#### Step 3: Prepare Your Project Locally
1. **Create the GitHub Actions Workflow File**:
   - In your GitHub repository, create the `.github/workflows` directory if it doesn't already exist.
   - Inside `.github/workflows/`, create a YAML file (e.g., `youtube-to-drive.yml`).

2. **Write a Python Script to Fetch YouTube Videos and Upload to Google Drive**:
   - In the root of your repository, create a file like `main.py` that contains the logic for:
     - **Authenticating with Google APIs** (using OAuth2 for both YouTube and Google Drive).
     - **Fetching the latest videos** from a specified YouTube channel.
     - **Uploading the videos** to Google Drive.

3. **Python Libraries**:
   Youâ€™ll need `google-auth`, `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, and `google-auth-httplib2`. You can install them by adding a `requirements.txt` file with these dependencies.

4. **Store OAuth 2.0 Credentials in GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - In **Settings**, under **Secrets** and **Variables**, create secrets for:
     - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS` (Store the raw content of your Google Drive OAuth 2.0 credentials JSON).
     - `YOUTUBE_API_CREDENTIALS` (Store the raw content of your YouTube API OAuth 2.0 credentials JSON).

#### Step 4: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

In your `.github/workflows/youtube-to-drive.yml`, create the following:

```yaml
name: YouTube to Google Drive

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Runs every 5 minutes
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Ensure it runs for the main branch

jobs:
  upload_videos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Authenticate with Google APIs
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS }}" > /tmp/google_drive_credentials.json
          echo "${{ secrets.YOUTUBE_API_CREDENTIALS }}" > /tmp/youtube_credentials.json
        env:
          GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS }}
          YOUTUBE_API_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.YOUTUBE_API_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: Run Python script
        run: python main.py
```

### Explanation of the Workflow:

1. **Triggers**:
   - The `on.schedule` section specifies that the workflow should run every 5 minutes (as defined by `*/5 * * * *` cron expression).
   - The `push` trigger ensures the workflow runs when there are changes pushed to the `main` branch.

2. **Jobs**:
   - The job `upload_videos` runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.
   
3. **Steps**:
   - `actions/checkout@v2`: This step checks out the repository so that the workflow can access your files.
   - `actions/setup-python@v2`: Sets up Python 3.x for the environment.
   - `Install dependencies`: Installs the necessary Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.
   - `Authenticate with Google APIs`: Uses GitHub secrets to authenticate with both YouTube and Google Drive APIs by creating a credentials file for each service. It places these credentials in the `/tmp` directory on the runner using the `echo` command.
   - `Run Python script`: Executes the `main.py` script to fetch the latest videos from YouTube and upload them to Google Drive.

#### Step 5: Write the Python Script (main.py)
In the `main.py` script, use the Google APIs to fetch YouTube videos and upload them to Google Drive. Here's a simple outline:

```python
import os
import google.auth
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.http import MediaFileUpload

# Authenticate to YouTube
def authenticate_youtube():
    credentials_file = '/tmp/youtube_credentials.json'
    creds = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(credentials_file, ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly']).run_local_server(port=0)
    youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', credentials=creds)
    return youtube

# Authenticate to Google Drive
def authenticate_drive():
    credentials_file = '/tmp/google_drive_credentials.json'
    creds = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(credentials_file, ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']).run_local_server(port=0)
    drive = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)
    return drive

# Fetch the latest YouTube videos
def get_latest_videos(youtube, channel_id):
    request = youtube.search().list(
        part="snippet",
        channelId=channel_id,
        order="date",
        maxResults=5
    )
    response = request.execute()
    return response['items']

# Upload video to Google Drive
def upload_to_drive(drive, video_file_path):
    file_metadata = {'name': os.path.basename(video_file_path)}
    media = MediaFileUpload(video_file_path)
    file = drive.files().create(body=file_metadata, media_body=media, fields='id').execute()
    return file

# Main function
def main():
    youtube = authenticate_youtube()
    drive = authenticate_drive()
    
    # Replace with the actual YouTube Channel ID
    channel_id = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID"
    
    videos = get_latest_videos(youtube, channel_id)
    
    for video in videos:
        video_file_path = download_video(video)  # You need to implement video download
        upload_to_drive(drive, video_file_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Python Script:
- **authenticate_youtube** and **authenticate_drive** handle authentication to the YouTube and Google Drive APIs, respectively. They use the credentials stored in the `/tmp` directory, which are created during the workflow by echoing the GitHub secrets into JSON files.
- **get_latest_videos** fetches the latest videos from the YouTube channel.
- **upload_to_drive** uploads a downloaded video to Google Drive.
- **download_video** would be a function where you would download the video to a local or temporary directory (you might need `youtube-dl` or a similar library).

#### Step 6: Add Required Python Packages to `requirements.txt`

```txt
google-auth
google-auth-oauthlib
google-auth-httplib2
google-api-python-client
```

#### Step 7: Test Your Workflow
- After setting up the workflow, commit and push the changes to the `main` branch.
- The GitHub Actions workflow will trigger every 5 minutes as per the cron schedule.
- Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow's progress.

### How to Get Google Drive and YouTube API Keys:

1. **For YouTube API**:
   - Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (if you don't have one).
   - In the **Library**, search for **YouTube Data API v3** and enable it.
   - Go to **Credentials**, create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** for accessing the API, and copy the content of the downloaded credentials JSON file to store it as `YOUTUBE_API_CREDENTIALS` in GitHub secrets.

2. **For Google Drive API**:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (if you don't have one).
   - In the **Library**, search for **Google Drive API** and enable it.
   - Go to **Credentials**, create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** for accessing the API, and copy the content of the downloaded credentials JSON file to store it as `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS` in GitHub secrets.

These credentials will now be available as GitHub secrets and used directly within your workflow.

This should cover all the steps and ensure that the credentials files are handled correctly within the GitHub Actions workflow.
