It seems like you're encountering an issue where you're trying to install MongoDB, but it's not being found, despite the fact that the package manager indicates that `libssl3t64` (a version of OpenSSL) is already installed. This might suggest a dependency or repository issue. Let me walk you through the potential causes and fixes:

### Possible Causes:
1. **MongoDB Repository Not Added:**
   MongoDB might not be available from the default Ubuntu repositories. If you're trying to install MongoDB, you will likely need to add the official MongoDB repository.

2. **Outdated Package Cache:**
   If the package manager's cache is outdated, it might not reflect available packages. Running an update could fix this.

3. **Incorrect Package Name or Typo:**
   Double-check that you're using the correct MongoDB package name for your system and distribution version.

### Step-by-Step Solutions:

#### 1. **Update Package Lists**
   First, update your package lists to ensure the most recent version of MongoDB is available:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

#### 2. **Add MongoDB's Official Repository**
   If MongoDB isn't found, you may need to manually add MongoDB's official repository for your Ubuntu version.

   To add the MongoDB repository for Ubuntu, follow these steps:

   - **Import MongoDB public key:**
     ```bash
     wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
     ```

   - **Add the MongoDB repository to your sources list:**

     For Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), use:

     ```bash
     echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
     ```

     For Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy), use:

     ```bash
     echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
     ```

   - **Update package list again:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

#### 3. **Install MongoDB**
   Once the repository is added, you can install MongoDB:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mongodb-org
   ```

#### 4. **Verify the Installation**
   After installation, verify that MongoDB is installed correctly:

   ```bash
   mongod --version
   ```

   This should show the installed version of MongoDB.

#### 5. **Start MongoDB (if needed)**
   If you want to start MongoDB right away, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

   To ensure MongoDB starts on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   ```

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install MongoDB on your Ubuntu system. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know, and we can troubleshoot further!
