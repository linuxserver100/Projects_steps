Deploying a React full-stack web application using GitHub Actions involves several steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set up the deployment:

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Ensure your full-stack application is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2. **Server Access**: Have access to a server (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.) where you can deploy your application.
3. **Environment Setup**: Ensure your server has Node.js, npm, and any required database installed.
4. **Domain Name (optional)**: If you want a custom domain, make sure it’s set up.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Application

1. **Build Your React App**: Ensure your React application is set up to build properly. Typically, you would run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command creates a `build` directory containing your production files.

2. **Server Configuration**: Ensure your backend API is set up to serve the built React app and handle requests appropriately.

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `SERVER_IP`: Your server's IP address.
   - `SSH_USER`: The SSH username for your server.
   - `SSH_KEY`: Your private SSH key (ensure your server accepts this key for authentication).
   - `REMOTE_PATH`: The path on your server where the application will be deployed.

### Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

1. In your repository, create a directory called `.github/workflows`.
2. Inside this directory, create a file named `deploy.yml` (or any name you prefer).

### Sample `deploy.yml`

Here’s a sample workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy React Full Stack App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Change to your deployment branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'  # Specify your Node.js version

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd client  # Change to your React app directory if nested
        npm install

    - name: Build React app
      run: |
        npm run build

    - name: Copy files to server
      uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}
        username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
        source: "client/build/*"  # Adjust path as necessary
        target: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}

    - name: SSH commands to restart server
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}
        username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
        script: |
          cd ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
          npm install # If you need to install server dependencies
          pm2 restart all # Adjust this according to your process manager
```

### Step 4: Configure Your Server

1. **Serve the React App**: Make sure your server is configured to serve the static files from the build directory.
   - Use a server like Nginx or Express.js to serve your React app.
   
2. **Start Your Backend**: Ensure your backend is running, possibly using a process manager like PM2.

### Step 5: Push Changes

1. Commit your changes and push them to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up deployment with GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Monitor Deployment

1. Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the deployment process.
2. Verify your application is accessible on the server.

### Additional Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Handle any environment variables necessary for your application.
- **Database Migrations**: If your backend requires database migrations, ensure you include those in your deployment script.

By following these steps, you should be able to deploy your React full-stack application to a server using GitHub Actions effectively.

Exmple with code steps of react app

Deploying a full-stack React application using GitHub Actions involves several steps, including building the application, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, and deploying to a hosting service. Here’s a step-by-step guide with example configurations.

### Step 1: Create a React Application

1. **Set Up a New React App**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-fullstack-app
   cd my-fullstack-app
   ```

2. **Create a Simple Backend (Node.js/Express)**:
   - Inside the root of your project, create a `server` folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir server
   cd server
   ```

   - Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   - Install Express:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   - Create a basic server (`server.js`):
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

   app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
     res.json({ message: 'Hello from the backend!' });
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Update React App to Call the Backend**:
   - Modify `src/App.js` in your React app:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   function App() {
     const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

     useEffect(() => {
       fetch('/api')
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(data => setMessage(data.message));
     }, []);

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>{message}</h1>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

### Step 2: Create Dockerfile for Both Frontend and Backend

1. **Create Dockerfile for React App**:
   - In the root of the project, create a `Dockerfile`:
   ```dockerfile
   # Build the React app
   FROM node:14 AS build
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
   RUN yarn install
   COPY . .
   RUN yarn build

   # Serve the app with Nginx
   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
   EXPOSE 80
   CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
   ```

2. **Create Dockerfile for Node.js Backend**:
   - In the `server` folder, create another `Dockerfile`:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 5000
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

1. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in the root directory:
   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'

         - name: Install dependencies and build
           run: |
             cd server
             npm install
             cd ..
             yarn install
             yarn build

         - name: Build Docker images
           run: |
             docker build -t my-react-app .
             docker build -t my-node-app ./server

         - name: Log in to Docker Hub
           uses: docker/login-action@v1
           with:
             username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
             password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

         - name: Push Docker images
           run: |
             docker tag my-react-app ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-react-app:latest
             docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-react-app:latest
             docker tag my-node-app ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-node-app:latest
             docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-node-app:latest

     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build
       steps:
         - name: Deploy to Hosting Service
           run: |
             # Add deployment commands here
             # Example: ssh to server and pull new images
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings.
   - Under "Secrets and variables," add the following secrets:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

### Step 4: Deploying to a Hosting Service

You can choose various hosting services like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku. Here’s a generic example for deploying to a server via SSH:

1. **SSH into Server and Deploy**:
   - Modify the `deploy` job in your GitHub Actions workflow to SSH into your server and pull the latest Docker images.

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: build
     steps:
       - name: SSH to Server
         uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.0
         with:
           host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
           username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USERNAME }}
           key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
           script: |
             docker pull ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-react-app:latest
             docker pull ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/my-node-app:latest
             docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Add Additional Secrets**:
   - Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
     - `SSH_HOST`: Your server's IP address.
     - `SSH_USERNAME`: Your server username.
     - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your SSH private key for accessing the server.

### Step 5: Monitor and Test

1. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Ensure that your GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully on push to the `main` branch.
  
2. **Access Your Application**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to your server's IP address or domain name to see the deployed React application.
